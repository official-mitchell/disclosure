Title:
USS Nimitz "Tic Tac" Encounter — The Video That Changed Everything

Origin:
United States Navy

Date:
November 14, 2004

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Commander David Fravor and Lt. Cmdr. Alex Dietrich were vectored by the USS Princeton toward something impossible.

A **white, oblong object** about 40 feet long — no wings, no exhaust, no visible propulsion — hovered over churning ocean. When Fravor descended, the object **mirrored his movements**. Then it accelerated from dead stop to **hypersonic speed** and vanished.

The object reappeared **60 miles away** at their pre-briefed CAP point _seconds later_.

Tracked on multiple sensors: SPY-1 radar, FLIR camera, four trained military aviators. **Multi-sensor corroboration** — the gold standard.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Source:
U.S. Navy official confirmation, declassified FLIR1 video, Congressional testimony under oath

SUPPORTING INTEL

The object exhibited the "**five observables**" — flight characteristics no known human technology can replicate:

1. Instantaneous acceleration (0 to Mach 3+ in less than a second)
2. Hypersonic velocity
3. Trans-medium travel capability
4. Low observability (minimal radar signature despite size)
5. No visible propulsion

Energy requirement estimates suggest **more power than a nuclear aircraft carrier** produces continuously.

TAKEAWAYS

1. U.S. military has tracked objects that outperform every aircraft ever built — for decades
2. Multi-sensor confirmation means this isn't hallucination, weather, or birds — something real was there
3. If not ours, not Russia's or China's (physics don't exist), then... you do the math

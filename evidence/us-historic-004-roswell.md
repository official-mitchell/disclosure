Title:
The Roswell Incident — Where Some Say It All Began (Or Where They Say It Didn't)

Origin:
United States Army Air Forces

Date:
July 1947

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** The government's official story has changed more times than a politician's campaign promises.

In early July 1947, something crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The **Army Air Forces initially announced** they had recovered a "flying disc." Headlines went global. Then, 24 hours later, the story changed: it was just a "weather balloon."

**Here's what makes this suspicious as hell:**

Ranch foreman Mac Brazel described debris that was **unlike anything he'd ever seen** — thin metallic material that you couldn't cut, burn, or dent. It would return to its original shape after being crumpled. (We didn't invent memory metal until decades later, by the way.)

The debris field stretched for **three-quarters of a mile**. That's one aggressive weather balloon.

Military personnel from the 509th Bomb Group (the only nuclear-armed unit in the world at the time) were dispatched to clean up... a weather balloon? They loaded it into planes and shipped it to multiple bases under armed guard.

**The government's evolving story:**

- 1947: "We found a flying disc!" → "JK it's a weather balloon"
- 1994: "Actually it was Project Mogul" (a secret balloon program)
- 1997: "The alien bodies were crash test dummies" (from tests that happened 6 years later — time travel much?)

Multiple military witnesses came forward decades later — including **Maj. Jesse Marcel**, the intelligence officer who handled the debris — saying the cover story was a lie.

**Simple analogy**: If your kid changes their story four times about how the window broke, you know they're hiding something. The government's done that with Roswell for 75 years.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Key testimonies that won't die:**

- **Maj. Jesse Marcel**: "It was not anything from this Earth." He went to his grave saying the debris was extraterrestrial.
- **Lt. Walter Haut**: The public information officer who wrote the original "flying disc" press release later signed an affidavit claiming he saw alien bodies
- **Glenn Dennis**: Local mortician claims he received calls from the base asking about child-sized coffins and embalming procedures for bodies exposed to the elements

**The Debris:**
Witnesses described:

- Extremely lightweight metallic material
- "Memory metal" that returned to shape
- Beams with purple hieroglyphic-like symbols
- Material that couldn't be burned or cut

**Why the 509th?**
The unit assigned to recover a "weather balloon" was the same unit that dropped atomic bombs on Japan. These weren't random Army grunts — they were the most elite, most trusted soldiers America had. For a balloon.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Something crashed at Roswell that was significant enough to initially warrant a "flying disc" announcement from the U.S. military
2. The government's explanation has shifted multiple times over 75+ years, which is classic cover-up behavior
3. Whether it was alien or advanced technology, the fact that we still don't have a straight answer suggests Roswell is the root of the secrecy tree

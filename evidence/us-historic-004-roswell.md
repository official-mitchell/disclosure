Title:
The Roswell Incident — Where Some Say It All Began (Or Where They Say It Didn't)

Origin:
United States Army Air Forces

Date:
July 1947

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** The government's official story has changed multiple times.

In early July 1947, something crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The **Army Air Forces initially announced** they recovered a "flying disc." Headlines went global. Then, 24 hours later: "weather balloon."

**What makes this suspicious:**

Ranch foreman Mac Brazel described debris **unlike anything he'd ever seen** — thin metallic material that couldn't be cut, burned, or dented. It returned to its original shape after being crumpled. (We didn't invent memory metal until decades later.)

The debris field stretched **three-quarters of a mile**. Military personnel from the 509th Bomb Group (the only nuclear-armed unit in the world) were dispatched to clean up... a weather balloon? They shipped it to multiple bases under armed guard.

**The government's evolving story:**

- 1947: "Flying disc!" → "Weather balloon"
- 1994: "Project Mogul" (secret balloon program)
- 1997: "Crash test dummies" (from tests 6 years later)

Multiple military witnesses, including **Maj. Jesse Marcel** (intelligence officer who handled debris), came forward saying the cover story was a lie.

Confidence: HIGH

Army Air Forces press release (July 8, 1947), subsequent military investigations, witness testimony from Marcel family and others

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Key testimonies:**

- **Maj. Jesse Marcel**: "It was not anything from this Earth." Went to his grave saying debris was extraterrestrial.
- **Lt. Walter Haut**: Public information officer who wrote the "flying disc" press release later signed an affidavit claiming he saw alien bodies
- **Glenn Dennis**: Local mortician claims he received calls asking about child-sized coffins and embalming procedures

**The debris:**

- Extremely lightweight metallic material
- "Memory metal" that returned to shape
- Beams with purple hieroglyphic-like symbols
- Material that couldn't be burned or cut

**Why the 509th?**

The unit assigned to recover a "weather balloon" was the same unit that dropped atomic bombs on Japan — the most elite, most trusted soldiers America had.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Something crashed at Roswell significant enough to warrant a "flying disc" announcement from the U.S. military
2. The government's explanation has shifted multiple times over 75+ years — classic cover-up behavior
3. Whether alien or advanced technology, we still don't have a straight answer — suggests Roswell is the root of the secrecy tree

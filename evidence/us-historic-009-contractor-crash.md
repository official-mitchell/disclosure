Title:
The Contractors Who Have "Our" Stuff — Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing

Origin:
United States / Congressional Testimony

Date:
1940s-Present (Alleged)

Summary:
**THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE UNDER OATH.** Multiple whistleblowers have testified that America's biggest defense contractors possess technology that doesn't belong to humanity.

**Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works**, **Northrop Grumman**, and **Boeing's Phantom Works** — the same companies building our stealth bombers and fighter jets — are allegedly sitting on crashed non-human spacecraft and have been trying to reverse-engineer them for decades.

Former Senate Majority Leader **Harry Reid** said publicly in 2020: "I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials."

**David Grusch** testified that crash retrieval programs were "insulated" inside private contractors specifically to **avoid congressional oversight and FOIA requests**. When it's Lockheed's "proprietary technology," the government can claim they have no control over it.

**The IRAD Loophole**: Defense contractors fund their own "Independent Research & Development" programs. The government reimburses them through general contracts. Result? Taxpayer money flowing to programs that Congress can't see.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**The Wilson-Davis Memo (2002):**

Leaked notes allegedly document a meeting where **Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson**, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, tried to access a **UAP reverse-engineering program**. He was denied by contractor executives despite having Top Secret clearance and statutory authority.

The program was described as involving "off-world" technology. Wilson was told he "didn't need to know" about the most secret program in American history.

**Why contractors?**

1. **Legal protection**: Private property isn't subject to FOIA
2. **Security clearance isolation**: Waived SAPs can exclude even senior government officials
3. **Talent concentration**: Best engineers already work there
4. **Deniability**: Government can truthfully say "we don't have UAP programs" while contractors do

**The Skunk Works culture**: Kelly Johnson's "14 Rules" created an organization designed for absolute secrecy. Small teams. Physical isolation. Zero paper trails. Perfect for hiding something that shouldn't exist.

**Contractor facilities mentioned**: Palmdale, California (Lockheed Skunk Works), Plant 42, Nevada Test Site periphery, underground facilities.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Multiple credible sources allege America's top defense contractors possess non-human technology and have been hiding it from government oversight for decades
2. The legal structures protecting contractor "proprietary technology" may have been deliberately exploited to keep Congress and Presidents in the dark
3. If true, this represents both the greatest technological secret in history and a fundamental breakdown of constitutional oversight

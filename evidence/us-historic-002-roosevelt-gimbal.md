Title:
USS Theodore Roosevelt "Gimbal" & "GoFast" — When Navy Pilots Stopped Laughing

Origin:
United States Navy

Date:
2014-2015

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** For months in 2014-2015, Navy pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered objects off the U.S. East Coast.

Lt. Ryan Graves reported a **"fleet" of objects** appearing on radar almost daily. One pilot nearly **collided with something** that looked like a "**dark cube inside a clear sphere**."

The "**Gimbal**" video shows an object **rotating 360 degrees** while maintaining flight path. The "**GoFast**" video shows an object at low altitude with zero visible propulsion.

These objects could sit **perfectly still in 120-knot headwinds** (hurricane-force), then accelerate to hypersonic instantly.

When the Roosevelt deployed to the **Middle East**, the objects showed up there too. They followed a U.S. carrier strike group across the planet.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Declassified Gimbal and GoFast videos, Navy hazard reports, Lt. Ryan Graves congressional testimony under oath

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why this matters:**

These objects operated in **restricted military airspace** with zero authorization, maneuvering around active carrier operations. Navy pilots filed **formal hazard reports**.

The Navy's response: silence for years, then "we don't know what those are."

**Flight characteristics:**

- Stationary hover in extreme wind
- Instant acceleration to hypersonic speeds
- No thermal exhaust signature
- No flight control surfaces
- Apparent ability to track military assets globally

TAKEAWAYS

1. This wasn't a one-time thing — Navy pilots saw these objects **daily for months**
2. Objects demonstrated awareness of military operations and appeared to surveil carrier strike groups
3. When elite pilots file safety reports about UFOs, something's very wrong with our understanding of who's in our airspace

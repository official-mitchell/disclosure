Title:
USS Theodore Roosevelt "Gimbal" & "GoFast" — When Navy Pilots Stopped Laughing

Origin:
United States Navy

Date:
2014-2015

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Real Navy pilots. Real radar. Real "what the f\*\*\*" energy.

For months in 2014-2015, Navy pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered objects off the U.S. East Coast that made the Tic Tac look like a warm-up act.

Lt. Ryan Graves reported a **"fleet" of objects** — not one, not two, but multiple — appearing on radar almost daily. One pilot described nearly **colliding with something** that looked like a "**dark cube inside a clear sphere**." (Yeah, read that again. A cube. In a sphere. Flying at you.)

The "**Gimbal**" video shows an object **rotating 360 degrees** while maintaining its flight path — which is like your car doing donuts while still driving straight down the highway. The "**GoFast**" video shows an object hauling ass at low altitude with zero visible propulsion.

**Here's the kicker**: These objects could sit **perfectly still in 120-knot headwinds**. That's hurricane-force wind. They didn't budge. Then — BOOM — hypersonic acceleration in the blink of an eye.

**Simple analogy**: Imagine a hummingbird that can also be a freight train whenever it feels like it. That's the vibe.

And here's what keeps Pentagon officials up at night: When the Roosevelt deployed to the **Middle East**, the objects showed up THERE too. These things followed a U.S. carrier strike group across the planet.

Either someone has technology that makes our trillion-dollar military look like we're throwing rocks... or we're not alone. Pick your poison.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why this matters for national security:**

These objects operated in **restricted military airspace** with zero authorization. They maneuvered around active carrier operations like they owned the place. Navy pilots filed **formal hazard reports** — the same thing you'd file if you almost hit another aircraft.

The Navy's response? Crickets for years. Then, finally, a quiet admission: "Yeah, we don't know what those are."

**Flight characteristics documented:**

- Stationary hover in extreme wind
- Instant acceleration to hypersonic speeds
- No thermal exhaust signature
- No flight control surfaces (wings, rudders, etc.)
- Apparent ability to track military assets globally

TAKEAWAYS

1. This wasn't a one-time thing — Navy pilots saw these objects **daily for months**
2. The objects demonstrated awareness of military operations and appeared to surveil carrier strike groups
3. When elite pilots start filing safety reports about UFOs, you know something's very wrong with our understanding of who's in our airspace

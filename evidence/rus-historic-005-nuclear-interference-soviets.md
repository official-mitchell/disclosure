Title:
Soviet Nuclear Sites — They Keep Showing Up at Our Missiles

Origin:
Soviet Union / Russian Ministry of Defense

Date:
1960s-1990s

Summary:
**THESE INCIDENTS WERE DOCUMENTED.** Soviet military records describe repeated UFO intrusions at nuclear facilities — sometimes with terrifying consequences.

UFOs have a thing for nuclear weapons. In the Soviet Union, this pattern played out repeatedly at ICBM sites, nuclear storage facilities, and strategic bomber bases.

The most alarming documented incident occurred at a **Ukrainian ICBM facility**. A UAP hovered for **four hours** above the missile base, observed by military personnel. During this time, control panels inside the facility suddenly showed that **launch codes had been entered** — the missiles were moments from launching.

Then, just as suddenly, the codes were cleared. The object departed.

Colonel Boris Sokolov, who investigated this incident, described it as "a message from wherever the UFOs originated." The message seemed clear: **"We can turn your weapons on whenever we want."**

This wasn't the only incident. Soviet Air Defense tracked numerous intrusions into restricted airspace around nuclear installations. Some objects simply observed. Others demonstrated more... active interest.

Confidence: HIGH

SUPPORTING INTEL

**The pattern across nuclear sites:**

Similar incidents occurred worldwide: **United States (1967)** — Malmstrom AFB, UFO hovers over missile silos, multiple ICBMs simultaneously go offline. **Soviet Union (multiple)** — Objects observed over strategic rocket forces installations. **United Kingdom (1980)** — Rendlesham Forest, UFO at nuclear weapons storage.

The objects appear to be **surveilling** nuclear capabilities, **demonstrating** they can access our most secure systems, and **sending messages** about our weapons.

**Soviet Air Defense response:**

After the Ukraine incident, Soviet military doctrine changed. Standing orders emphasized: Document all sightings, do NOT attempt interception, report up chain of command immediately.

The policy shift suggests leadership recognized they were dealing with something that could override their most sophisticated systems at will.

**Why nuclear sites?**

Theories range from concern about nuclear war (NHI preventing human self-destruction), scientific interest (nuclear reactions observable from distance), power source attraction, or strategic intelligence (mapping humanity's most dangerous capabilities).

**The timing:** Soviet nuclear incidents peaked during the Cold War's most tense periods.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Soviet nuclear facilities experienced repeated intrusions by objects that demonstrated the ability to interface with launch systems — this is documented military history, not speculation
2. The pattern of nuclear-site interest appears global, affecting both superpowers' most sensitive installations
3. Whatever these objects are, they've been monitoring (and possibly manipulating) our nuclear arsenals for decades — and we can't stop them

Multiple

Date:
January 2025

Summary:
Scientists from all three programs, communicating through back channels, have drafted a consensus statement: "No single nation's research has achieved propulsion breakthrough. Combined, our data might. Continued secrecy guarantees collective failure. We, the undersigned, recommend immediate scientific cooperation under international oversight."

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Informal Scientific Working Group

SUPPORTING INTEL

Dr. Maya Badman, Dr. Oscar Morozov, and Dr. Morty Qiao are among the signatories. Dr. Chris Smirnov provided crucial theoretical insights. They're risking everything because they believe the alternative — continued secrecy — is extinction.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Scientists across all blocs agree: cooperation is necessary
2. The data must be combined to succeed
3. Signing this is career suicide — they did it anyway
4. The politicians need to catch up to the scientists

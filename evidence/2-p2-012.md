Summary:
A Pentagon intern accidentally accessed a classified database while trying to find the cafeteria menu.

The intern has signed 47 NDAs and now works at a Starbucks in Montana.

SUPPORTING INTEL

Lt. Chris Ries was the officer who handled the incident. The database name was "COSMIC PERSONNEL." This matches the "COSMIC CLEARANCE" mentioned by the captured American operative. "Non-terrestrial officers" suggests either off-planet personnel or... something else entirely.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Even the bureaucracy can't keep secrets

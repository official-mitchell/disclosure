SUPPORTING INTEL

The draft mentions interviews with "three former employees of aerospace companies who described identical craft in hangars in Nevada, Australia, and the United Kingdom." One source allegedly said, "They've had this stuff since before I was born, and they still can't make it work." Candace has been continuing the investigation quietly.

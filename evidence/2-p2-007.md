SUPPORTING INTEL

Captain Perry Sun's patrol squadron reported a similar object in the South China Sea two weeks later. Cmdr. Roberto De La Torres reviewed the footage and said, "That's not ours, and it's not theirs." Admiral Kannon Zhou ordered the Chinese encounter classified at the highest level.

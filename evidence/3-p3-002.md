Confidence: UNVERIFIED

Anonymous Diplomatic Pouch — All Three Blocs Received Identical Copies

SUPPORTING INTEL

The document demonstrates detailed knowledge of ALL THREE blocs' programs — information no single country should have. Either someone has penetrated all three, or... the source is not from any government. The document ends with: "You are not alone, and you are running out of time."

TAKEAWAYS

1. Someone knows everything about all programs
2. They want cooperation
3. The timeline warning suggests external pressure
4. This is signed "CONVERGENCE" — same as Maggie's source

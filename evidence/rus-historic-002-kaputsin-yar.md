Title:
Kapustin Yar — Russia's Area 51 (They Have One Too)

Origin:
Soviet Union / Russian Federation

Date:
1948-Present

Summary:
**THIS IS A REAL PLACE.** Russia's most secretive missile test range may also be its most important UFO storage facility.

**Kapustin Yar** is to Russia what Area 51 is to America — except the Russians have been less careful about keeping their mouths shut.

Located in the Astrakhan Oblast, Kapustin Yar has been the Soviet/Russian military's primary missile testing facility since 1946. But according to multiple defectors and leaked documents, it's also where the Soviets stored their **recovered UFO materials**.

**Specific allegations:**

- **22 small fragments** stored at "Point No. 31"
- At least one **intact craft** housed in bunkers northeast of the main facility
- A disc that **underwent flight testing** with hybrid Soviet/unknown propulsion systems

In 1948, just one year after Roswell, something allegedly crashed near Kapustin Yar. The recovery operation was massive. The debris went underground — literally.

**Military Unit 155644** was reportedly assigned to crash retrieval operations. Their job: Get to crash sites fast, secure the perimeter, and make the debris disappear.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**The 1948 crash:**

Soviet records allegedly describe a disc-shaped craft recovered in the Kapustin Yar area just one year after Roswell. The timing is interesting — was there a wave of crashes?

**The flight testing claim:**

At least one source describes Soviet engineers attempting to **fly a recovered disc** by integrating conventional jet engines. The results were reportedly mixed. The craft exhibited strange behaviors their engineers couldn't control.

**Underground storage:**

Kapustin Yar sits on top of an extensive **underground facility network**. Tunnels reportedly extend for kilometers. The Russians have never fully disclosed what's stored there, and satellite imagery shows constant construction activity for decades.

**KGB involvement:**

The KGB maintained dedicated UFO investigation files. Unlike the American Air Force's dismissive Project Blue Book, Soviet intelligence took the phenomenon seriously enough to conduct systematic investigations, establish rapid-response recovery teams, store materials at secured facilities, and brief senior leadership.

**Why has Russia been quieter than America?**

Authoritarian state = total information control. There's no Russian FOIA, no Congressional hearings, no whistleblower protections. What the Kremlin wants buried stays buried.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Russia maintains a facility repeatedly linked to UFO crash retrievals and materials storage since 1948
2. The existence of dedicated military units for crash retrieval suggests this wasn't a one-time event — it was an ongoing operation
3. If both superpowers have been recovering and storing non-human technology for 75+ years, the question isn't "if" but "what have they learned?"

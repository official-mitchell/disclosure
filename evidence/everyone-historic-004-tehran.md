Title:
1976 Tehran F-4 Incident — When Iran's Best Jet Went Weapons-Dead

Origin:
Imperial Iranian Air Force / U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency

Date:
September 19, 1976

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Documented in a declassified DIA report rated as meeting "all criteria for valid UFO study."

Iranian Air Force scrambled an F-4 Phantom after civilians reported a bright object over Tehran. When the first F-4 got within 25 miles, **all instrumentation and communications went dead**. A second F-4 got radar lock (object was Boeing 707-sized), but when preparing to fire, **weapons control went completely offline**.

A smaller object **detached from the main craft** and approached the fighter. The pilot dove to escape, but the object circled him, then returned to the parent craft.

The object eventually landed, bathing a dry lake bed in intense light. The next morning, beeper signals were detected — but no source was found.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

**DIA assessment highlights:**

- Multiple sensor systems affected (radar, communications, weapons)
- Multiple credible witnesses (military pilots, ground control, civilians)
- Intelligent behavior (smaller craft responded to fighter's actions)
- Electromagnetic effects consistent with other UAP weapons failures
- Potential physical traces (radiation-like readings at landing site)

The DIA rated this **exceptionally significant** — trained observers, radar confirmation, equipment malfunction, and landing traces in one incident. This report went straight to Washington during the Cold War.

TAKEAWAYS

1. UAPs can **disable military weapons systems** — massive implications for national defense
2. The phenomenon exhibits **intelligent, responsive behavior** — not random atmospheric events
3. Major powers have documented these encounters for decades
4. If these objects can neutralize weapons at will, "air superiority" needs reconsideration

Title:
The Voronezh Landing — When Aliens Walked Out in Front of Soviet Kids

Origin:
Soviet Union

Date:
September 27, 1989

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Soviet state media reported it. Witnesses included children, adults, and police. Beings reportedly emerged from a craft.

On September 27, 1989, in the Soviet city of **Voronezh**, something landed in a public park. Multiple witnesses — including children, adults, and local militia (police) — reported a **large, shiny ball** descending into Yuzhny Park. A hatch opened. Beings emerged.

Witnesses described a **tall entity** (approximately 3 meters/10 feet) accompanied by what appeared to be a robot. The entity had three eyes and was wearing silver clothing. It reportedly walked around, examining the area, before returning to the craft and departing.

**Soviet state media — not known for wild tabloid stories — reported this on national television.**

TASS, the official Soviet news agency, ran the story. Pravda covered it. International media picked it up. This wasn't fringe conspiracy — it was reported by the most state-controlled press apparatus on Earth.

The landing occurred during a massive wave of sightings across Europe — Belgium, the UK, and other Eastern Bloc nations were experiencing their own encounters around the same time.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Physical evidence:**

- **Ground depressions** at the landing site consistent with heavy weight
- **Elevated radiation levels** in the affected area
- A **rock** allegedly left behind that exhibited unusual properties
- Multiple independent witness descriptions that aligned

**Why did the Soviets report it publicly?**

Theories include: **Glasnost effect** (Gorbachev's "openness" policy), **too many witnesses** (event in public park couldn't be easily covered up), **test balloon** (government gauging public reaction), or **distraction** (domestic problems mounting).

**The Belgian connection:**

The Voronezh incident occurred during the same period as the **Belgian UFO wave** (1989-1990), where triangular craft were observed by thousands and tracked by NATO radar. Whatever was happening, it was happening across Europe simultaneously.

**Witness descriptions (consistent):**

- Spherical craft, metallic appearance
- Tall humanoid with three eyes
- Smaller robotic companion
- Entity appeared to survey surroundings
- No apparent hostile intent
- Departed peacefully

TAKEAWAYS

1. A UFO landing with entity emergence was reported by official Soviet state media — the most tightly controlled press in the world didn't make up alien stories
2. The incident coincided with a broader European wave of sightings, suggesting coordinated or related activity
3. Physical evidence and multiple independent witnesses gave this case more substance than most — yet it remains unexplained

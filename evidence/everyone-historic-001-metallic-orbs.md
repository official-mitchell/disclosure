Title:
The Metallic Orbs — They're Everywhere and Nobody Knows What They Are

Origin:
Global / Multiple Countries

Date:
2004-Present

Summary:
**THIS IS HAPPENING WORLDWIDE.** Metallic spheres account for roughly half of all military UAP reports globally. They range from 3-13 feet, appear metallic, show no propulsion, and accelerate from stationary to Mach 2+ instantly.

**One orb was hit by a missile and completely unaffected** — continuing as if nothing happened. Multiple incidents show orbs flying in coordinated formations, suggesting intelligence rather than random phenomena.

Reports span all continents: U.S. military bases, Middle East combat zones, European airports, Asian commercial flights. This is a global phenomenon.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Source:
AARO Congressional testimony, multiple military witnesses, declassified footage, international aviation reports

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Common characteristics:**

- Spherical, metallic appearance with no visible propulsion
- Impossible acceleration (0 to hypersonic instantly)
- Coordinated formation behavior suggesting intelligence
- Non-reactive to weapons (missile strikes have no effect)

**Geographic pattern:**

Orbs concentrate around military installations, nuclear facilities, and active combat zones — suggesting targeted surveillance of human military activity.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Metallic orbs are the most common UAP worldwide — a global phenomenon, not isolated incidents
2. Invulnerability to weapons and impossible flight characteristics eliminate all conventional explanations
3. Coordinated formations suggest intelligent control — these aren't random phenomena

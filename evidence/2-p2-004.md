SUPPORTING INTEL

The Russian official has been tentatively identified as Jack Kadyrov. The American appears to be Kassidy Neville. If this photograph is authentic, it proves secret US-Russia collaboration on recovered technology — and China has been excluded.

TAKEAWAYS

1. US and Russia may be secretly allied
2. China has been deliberately cut out
3. Jack Kadyrov and Kassidy Neville are in this photograph
4. Is this real, or disinformation designed to fracture trust?

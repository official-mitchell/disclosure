Title:
February 2023 NORAD Shootdowns — When the U.S. Downed Three "Objects" and Then Got Real Quiet

Origin:
NORAD / U.S. Northern Command / White House

Date:
February 10-12, 2023

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** The U.S. military shot down three unidentified objects over North America in three days (February 10-12, 2023). Then silence.

**February 10**: Object over Alaska — "cylindrical, silver-gray, small car-sized" at 40,000 feet.

**February 11**: Object over Canada's Yukon — "cylindrical" with no visible propulsion.

**February 12**: Object over Lake Huron — "octagonal" with strings.

**Then... silence.** No wreckage recovery announcements. No analysis results. No explanation.

Officials suggested "balloons" for "commercial purposes," but: you don't send F-22s to shoot down party balloons, altitudes/flight patterns were inconsistent with weather balloons, and if mundane, why not say so?

Confidence: CONFIRMED (shootdowns happened) / UNRESOLVED (true nature of objects)

Source:
Pentagon press briefings, NORAD official statements, White House press conferences, Congressional testimony

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Official narrative vs. reality:**

- Told: "likely balloons," recovery underway, analysis coming
- Reality: No wreckage recovered from Alaska or Yukon, Lake Huron object never recovered, no owner came forward, Congressional briefings led to silence

**Suspicious details:**

- Alaska object shot down over remote indigenous lands — minimal witnesses
- NORAD adjusted radar sensitivity and suddenly detected lots of things — implying these objects **were always there**
- Some pilots reported objects "maneuvered" before being hit

NORAD commander General VanHerck, asked if he could rule out extraterrestrial origins: **"I haven't ruled out anything."** That quote made headlines, then was memory-holed.

TAKEAWAYS

1. **U.S. military shot down three unidentified objects in 72 hours** — never adequately explained
2. The silence suggests either embarrassingly mundane or embarrassingly not mundane
3. NORAD's "adjusted radar sensitivity" admission means we've been missing things for years
4. If foreign surveillance, that's a massive security failure. If not foreign or not human... different problems
5. The "balloon" explanation requires no evidence because nothing was recovered — convenient

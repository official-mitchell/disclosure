SUPPORTING INTEL

Intercepted shipping manifests show deliveries of exotic materials including bismuth, magnesium-zinc alloys, and industrial quantities of liquid helium. A Chinese defector mentioned "the Mountain" as a site where "recovered objects are studied." Sofia Chen's logistics records show she coordinated several shipments to the region.

TAKEAWAYS

1. China has a major black site in Xinjiang
2. The power consumption suggests exotic research
3. Materials match known UAP debris compositions
4. Sofia Chen may have direct knowledge of "The Mountain"

Title:
Aguadilla, Puerto Rico — The Object That Split In Two and Dove Into the Ocean

Origin:
U.S. Customs and Border Protection / Department of Homeland Security

Date:
April 25, 2013

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Captured on thermal video by a DHS aircraft. You can watch it yourself — it's on YouTube.

At approximately 9:20 PM, a DHC-8 turboprop operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection spotted a **pinkish-red light** moving over the ocean at low altitude near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.

Filmed in infrared for approximately **four minutes**: A **small, dark object** (estimated 3-5 feet in diameter) traveling at speeds between **40-120 mph** — sometimes much faster. The object exhibited:

1. **Trans-medium travel**: Entered the water, traveled underwater, and emerged again multiple times — without any change in speed or behavior
2. **Object splitting**: At one point, **appeared to split into two separate objects** that traveled together before potentially merging again
3. **No visible propulsion**: No exhaust, no rotor wash, no heat signature consistent with known propulsion

The Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) conducted a **detailed frame-by-frame analysis** and published a peer-reviewed style report. Their conclusion: no conventional explanation fits the data.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

**SCU analysis:**

- **Speed calculations**: Object accelerated and decelerated in ways inconsistent with balloons, drones, or birds
- **Submersion analysis**: Object clearly enters and exits water while maintaining trajectory
- **Heat signature**: Object was cooler than ambient water temperature — rules out combustion-based propulsion
- **"Splitting" event**: Frame-by-frame shows either object division or a second object emerging from behind

The airport shut down temporarily during the encounter. This happened **near a U.S. military facility** (Ramey Air Force Base used to house nuclear bombers).

What makes this case devastating for skeptics: It's government footage, government witnesses, and multiple independent analysts agree something anomalous happened.

TAKEAWAYS

1. **Trans-medium capability is real**: This object operated in both air and water domains seamlessly — our submarines and aircraft cannot do this
2. **Object "reproduction" or splitting**: Whether one object becoming two or some other phenomenon, this challenges our understanding of physics
3. **Government agencies have been capturing this footage** without public acknowledgment for years
4. These objects operate near critical infrastructure and seem completely unbothered by our presence

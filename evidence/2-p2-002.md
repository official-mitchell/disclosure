Title:
SCIENTIST VALIDATION KEY — The Propulsion Anomaly

Origin:
Multiple

Date:
[CLASSIFIED]

Summary:
Your research has confirmed a theoretical framework for inertial mass reduction. When specific electromagnetic frequencies are applied to metamaterials containing the anomalous isotope, objects exhibit reduced gravitational interaction. You've seen the math. It works. Barely.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

This matches descriptions from Sofia Chen's propulsion program, Roberto De La Torres's encounter reports, and theoretical work by Morty Qiao. If someone describes silent, hovering vehicles with impossible acceleration, they're not lying — you've seen the equations that explain it.

TAKEAWAYS

1. You can VALIDATE claims about exotic propulsion
2. The technology is REAL but poorly understood
3. Multiple countries are working on the same problem
4. Cooperation might actually solve it faster

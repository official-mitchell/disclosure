Title:
Thread Three (Нить-3) — The Soviet Reverse-Engineering Program

Origin:
Soviet Ministry of Defense

Date:
1978-1991

Summary:
**THIS PROGRAM EXISTED.** Soviet officials have confirmed it. The goal was simple: beat America to alien technology.

**Thread Three** (Нить-3) was the Soviet Union's most ambitious attempt to develop technology "superior to anything the Americans had" — and they planned to do it by studying UFOs.

**Colonel Boris Sokolov**, the Ministry of Defense program director, stated explicitly in post-Soviet interviews: "The objective was to basically develop technology that would be superior to anything [the US had] based on what they learned from UFOs."

The program operated from **1978-1991** and documented over **45 fighter intercept incidents** where Soviet jets engaged unidentified aerial objects. Three of those engagements involved pilots who **fired weapons at UAPs**.

All three pilots died.

Their aircraft experienced **immediate systems failure** and crashed. The Soviet Air Defense Forces subsequently issued standing orders: **"Leave UFOs alone. They may have incredible capacities for retaliation."**

SUPPORTING INTEL

**The pilot deaths:**

Three separate incidents where pilots engaged UFOs and experienced immediate, total aircraft failure. The pattern was clear enough that command issued explicit non-engagement orders.

Whatever these objects are, they can defend themselves.

**The nuclear incident:**

Colonel Sokolov described an incident at a Ukrainian ICBM facility where a UAP hovered for **four hours** over a strategic missile base. During this time, the object exhibited "fission/fusion behavior" — splitting into components, reintegrating.

Then it spontaneously **entered correct launch codes** for the nuclear missiles.

Sokolov called it "a message from wherever the UFOs originated." The world was seconds from nuclear war initiated by an unknown intelligence.

**Program structure:**

Thread Three operated alongside "The Network" (SETKA), a joint civilian-military investigation program running from 1978-1990. Civilian scientists analyzed reports for scientific anomalies; military units treated UFOs as potential enemy technology.

**Why Russia talked (eventually):**

The Soviet collapse in 1991 loosened tongues. Former officials who'd been bound by secrecy for decades suddenly had less incentive to keep quiet. Western journalists like George Knapp obtained **thousands of pages** of Ministry of Defense UFO files during this chaotic period.

TAKEAWAYS

1. The Soviet Union ran a dedicated program to reverse-engineer UFO technology and compete with the United States in the most secret arms race in history
2. Soviet pilots who engaged UFOs aggressively experienced fatal consequences — these objects can apparently defend themselves
3. A UAP at a nuclear missile base demonstrated the ability to access launch codes — suggesting either impossible signals intelligence capabilities or something far stranger

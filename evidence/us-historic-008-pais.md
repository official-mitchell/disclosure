Title:
The Pais Patents — When the U.S. Navy Filed for "UFO Technology"

Origin:
United States Navy / U.S. Patent Office

Date:
2016-2019

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** The U.S. Navy filed patents for technology that sounds like sci-fi — and told the Patent Office it was operationally important.

Between 2016-2019, **Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais**, a Navy aerospace engineer, filed patents so bizarre the Patent Office initially rejected them as "inoperable."

What changed their mind? The **Navy's Chief Technical Officer**, Dr. James Sheehy, personally wrote stating these technologies were feasible and that **"China is already investing significantly in this area."**

**The patents include:**

1. **Inertial Mass Reduction Device**: A craft that generates electromagnetic fields to reduce its own mass, enabling impossible acceleration
2. **Room-Temperature Superconductor**: Technology that would revolutionize energy transmission
3. **High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator**: Propulsion through gravitational field manipulation
4. **Hybrid Aerospace-Underwater Craft**: A vehicle that can operate in air, water, and space — exactly what UAPs have been observed doing

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why would the Navy do this?**

Option A: Real breakthrough technologies — Navy establishing IP rights
Option B: Disinformation patents to confuse foreign adversaries
Option C: Reverse-engineered from recovered craft — Navy needed legal cover

All three options are disturbing.

**Technical details:**

The "inertial mass reduction device" describes using **high-frequency electromagnetic fields** to create localized spacetime metric distortions — making a bubble where physics works differently, allowing acceleration that would normally turn a pilot into jelly.

This is **exactly** the theoretical framework physicists have proposed for how UAPs might operate.

**Dr. Sheehy's letter**: "The Chinese are not yet procuring or patenting in the space, which is a way that the U.S. maintains its technological advantage... China is already investing significantly in this area."

Translation: "We need these patents because there's a race happening that we can't talk about publicly."

**Coincidence?** The described propulsion mechanisms match what witnesses have reported seeing UAPs do for 75+ years.

TAKEAWAYS

1. The U.S. Navy holds patents for technology that matches UAP performance characteristics — either they invented it, reverse-engineered it, or they're running disinformation
2. The Navy's CTO personally intervened to ensure these patents were granted, citing China competition — indicating this isn't theoretical nonsense
3. If these technologies are real, everything we think we know about physics and aerospace is incomplete

# PHASE 1 EVIDENCE

## P1-001: The Kapustin Yar Anomaly Report

**Target:** Russia → Scientists (Oscar, Chris)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Russia  
**Event Date:** February 3, 1989  
**Source:** Ministry of Defense Archives — Recovered Document

**Backstory:**
A routine materials analysis from Kapustin Yar in 1989 was recently declassified by accident. The report describes a metallic sample with "impossible isotopic ratios" and a crystalline structure that "does not conform to known metallurgical processes." The scientist who authored the report disappeared three weeks after submission.

**Supporting Intel:**
The sample was catalogued as "K-7-ECHO" and transferred to an unknown facility. Internal memos reference "American interest" in acquiring similar samples. One margin note reads: "Compare to Roswell debris — similarities confirmed."

**Takeaways:**

- K-7-ECHO exists and was studied by Soviet scientists
- Americans may have parallel samples
- Scientists who ask too many questions disappear
- Look for anyone else who mentions "isotopic ratios" or "K-7-ECHO"

## P1-002: The Langley Mole Hunt

**Target:** US → Spies (Brea, Deniz)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** November 12, 2024  
**Source:** CIA Counterintelligence — Internal Memo

**Backstory:**
Counterintelligence has identified a potential leak within the agency. Classified documents related to "Project LOOKING GLASS" appeared on a dark web forum before being scrubbed. The leak pattern suggests someone with access to both scientific and diplomatic channels.

**Supporting Intel:**
Three individuals are under suspicion. One is described as "having recent unexplained travel to European capitals." Another "has family connections to a foreign government." Analysis suggests the mole may not be American at all, but an asset who turned. One suspect matches the profile of someone at a D.C. think tank with intelligence connections.

**Takeaways:**

- Someone in the US delegation is leaking
- Project LOOKING GLASS is real and sensitive
- Watch for anyone with "European travel" or "family connections abroad"
- The mole might be Brea Balloon — or someone using her as cover

**Target:** China → Politicians (Jake, Julia)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** shareable_if_pressed  
**Origin Country:** UK  
**Event Date:** August 8, 2024  
**Source:** MI6 Field Report — Hong Kong Station

**Backstory:**
British intelligence observed Admiral Kannon Zhou meeting with an unidentified American at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. The meeting lasted 47 minutes. No recording was obtained, but lip-reading analysis caught the phrase "mutual assured survival."

**Supporting Intel:**
The American was later identified as potentially connected to Northrop Grumman's black programs division. Admiral Zhou left Hong Kong the next morning on a military flight to a "training facility" that doesn't appear on any official maps.

**Takeaways:**

- Admiral Kannon Zhou is talking to Americans secretly
- "Mutual assured survival" suggests shared threat awareness
- Kassidy Neville may be the American contact
- Someone in China is breaking protocol

## P1-004: The São Paulo Intercept

**Target:** US → Military (Chris, Roberto)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Brazil  
**Event Date:** March 15, 2024  
**Source:** NSA SIGINT — COMINT Transcript

**Backstory:**
NSA intercepted a phone call between a Brazilian military attaché and an unknown Russian speaker. The Russian mentioned "the American officer who visited last month" and asked about "his interest in the Varginha materials." The Brazilian refused to elaborate and hung up.

**Supporting Intel:**
Varginha, Brazil was the site of an alleged UFO incident in 1996. The Brazilian military has always denied involvement. This intercept suggests materials were recovered and that an American military officer has shown interest. Travel records show Cmdr. Roberto De La Torres was in São Paulo during the relevant timeframe.

**Takeaways:**

- Someone from US military visited Brazil recently
- Russians are tracking American movements
- "Varginha materials" are real and contested
- Roberto De La Torres may know more than he's saying

## P1-005: Dr. Juliette Wang's Research Anomalies

**Target:** China → Scientists (Cara, Morty)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** unknown  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** China  
**Event Date:** September 1, 2024  
**Source:** MSS Internal Personnel File

**Backstory:**
Dr. Juliette Wang, senior astrobiologist at the State Research Academy, filed a classified report that was immediately suppressed. Her analysis of organic compounds found at a "recovery site" in Xinjiang contained signatures "inconsistent with terrestrial biochemistry." She was warned to focus on "conventional interpretations."

**Supporting Intel:**
Dr. Wang has been unusually quiet in recent months. Her access to certain facilities was revoked without explanation. Colleagues note she's been working closely with Dr. Cara Huang on "data verification" projects that aren't on any official schedule.

**Takeaways:**

- Dr. Juliette Wang found something extraordinary
- She's being silenced or self-censoring
- Dr. Cara Huang may be helping her hide or verify data
- Someone should ask what's in that suppressed report

## P1-006: The Northrop Grumman Whistleblower

**Target:** US → Executives (Kassidy)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** shareable_if_pressed  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** June 22, 2024  
**Source:** Anonymous Tip to Senate Intelligence Committee

**Backstory:**
A letter arrived at the Senate Intelligence Committee claiming that Northrop Grumman has been running a "legacy recovery program" since 1961. The letter alleges the company possesses "three intact vehicles of non-human origin" and has spent $14 billion in black budget funds reverse-engineering them — with minimal success.

**Supporting Intel:**
The letter included a photograph of what appears to be a warehouse interior with a disc-shaped object under a tarp. Metadata analysis was inconclusive. The letter was signed "A Patriot Who Has Seen Enough." Rep. Maria St. Germain has been quietly asking questions about Kassidy Neville's program portfolio.

**Takeaways:**

- Northrop Grumman may be hiding recovered craft
- $14 billion in black budget funds is unaccounted for
- Someone inside wants this public
- Kassidy Neville oversees black programs — what does she know?

## P1-007: Maddie Volkov's Double Life

**Target:** Russia → Spies (Maddie)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Russia  
**Event Date:** January 5, 2025  
**Source:** GRU Internal Affairs — Surveillance Report

**Backstory:**
GRU surveillance has flagged anomalies in Maddie Volkov's communications. Despite her cover as an "arms dealer's wife," she's been observed meeting with individuals who don't appear in any official contact lists. Her encrypted communications show patterns consistent with a secondary handler.

**Supporting Intel:**
Maddie's husband Jack Kadyrov believes she's loyal to him. He doesn't know about the Swiss bank account receiving quarterly deposits from a shell company traced to Virginia. She has not been arrested because GRU wants to see who she's feeding — and whether Jack is compromised too.

**Takeaways:**

- Maddie Volkov may be a double agent
- The CIA (Virginia) may be running her
- Jack Kadyrov doesn't know about his wife's activities
- Watch who Maddie talks to — they may be targets or handlers

## P1-008: The Vatican Cable

**Target:** All Players  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** unknown  
**Confidentiality:** public  
**Origin Country:** Vatican City  
**Event Date:** December 24, 2024  
**Source:** Leaked Diplomatic Cable — WikiLeaks

**Backstory:**
A diplomatic cable from the Vatican's Secretariat of State to "select world leaders" was leaked online. It references preparations for "a theological framework for non-human intelligence" and requests discretion from recipients. The Vatican has declined to comment.

**Supporting Intel:**
The cable mentions a private audience with the Pope scheduled for early 2025, with invitations extended to representatives from the US, Russia, and China. The subject is listed only as "matters of cosmic significance." Candace Bradley has been investigating this story.

**Takeaways:**

- The Vatican is preparing for disclosure
- World leaders are being briefed
- Religious institutions may know more than governments
- Someone leaked this deliberately — why now?

---

## P1-009: Candace Bradley's Last Investigation

**Target:** All → Journalists (Candace, Maggie, Harrison)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** shareable_if_pressed  
**Origin Country:** UK  
**Event Date:** October 10, 2024  
**Source:** The Guardian — Unpublished Draft (Obtained via Source)

**Backstory:**
A journalist colleague of Candace Bradley was working on an exposé about defense contractor black sites when she died in a car accident. Her laptop was recovered by police but all files related to her investigation were "corrupted." Candace managed to recover a partial draft through back channels.

**Supporting Intel:**
The draft mentions interviews with "three former employees of aerospace companies who described identical craft in hangars in Nevada, Australia, and the United Kingdom." One source allegedly said, "They've had this stuff since before I was born, and they still can't make it work." Candace has been continuing the investigation quietly.

**Takeaways:**

- A journalist got too close to the truth
- Multiple countries have recovered craft
- Reverse-engineering efforts have largely failed
- Candace Bradley knows more than she's published

## P1-010: The Xinjiang Facility

**Target:** US → Spies (Brea, Deniz)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** July 30, 2024  
**Source:** NRO Satellite Imagery — Classified Analysis

**Backstory:**
National Reconnaissance Office satellites identified a new underground facility in Xinjiang, China. Thermal imaging shows massive power consumption inconsistent with any known industrial or military purpose. Construction began in 2021 and appears complete.

**Supporting Intel:**
Intercepted shipping manifests show deliveries of exotic materials including bismuth, magnesium-zinc alloys, and industrial quantities of liquid helium. A Chinese defector mentioned "the Mountain" as a site where "recovered objects are studied." Sofia Chen's logistics records show she coordinated several shipments to the region.

**Takeaways:**

- China has a major black site in Xinjiang
- The power consumption suggests exotic research
- Materials match known UAP debris compositions
- Sofia Chen may have direct knowledge of "The Mountain"

## P1-011: Admiral Diego Kuznetsov's Drinking Problem

**Target:** Russia → Politicians (Eliza)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** November 28, 2024  
**Source:** CIA HUMINT — Embassy Source

**Backstory:**
Admiral Diego Kuznetsov was observed drinking heavily at a diplomatic reception in Geneva. In a moment of candor with an American counterpart, he allegedly said, "Your people and our people are both idiots. Neither of you understand what you're sitting on. But the Chinese — they're actually making progress."

**Supporting Intel:**
Diego was escorted out by his security detail shortly after. The next day, Eliza Karimov was dispatched to "manage the situation." His current status is under review. The American diplomat who heard this has been instructed not to discuss it.

**Takeaways:**

- Russia admits they don't fully understand their recovered materials
- China may be ahead in reverse-engineering
- Admiral Kuznetsov may be a liability — or a truth-teller
- Eliza Karimov is cleaning up messes

## P1-012: The Pentagon's Missing Money

**Target:** US → Politicians (Bernardo, Maria, Sarah)  
**Phase:** 1  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** shareable_if_pressed  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** May 5, 2024  
**Source:** Government Accountability Office — Classified Audit

**Backstory:**
A classified GAO audit found $23 billion in Pentagon spending that cannot be accounted for over the past decade. The funds were dispersed through a network of shell contracts to aerospace companies. When investigators requested documentation, they were told the programs were "outside congressional oversight."

**Supporting Intel:**
Senator Bernardo Reis has been pushing for answers. One auditor who pushed too hard was transferred to a desk job in Alaska. Another quietly resigned and now works for Lockheed Martin. Rep. Sarah Fierce, former Lockheed executive, has been notably quiet on this issue.

**Takeaways:**

- $23 billion is hidden in black programs
- Congress doesn't know where the money goes
- Aerospace companies are the beneficiaries
- Sarah Fierce may have conflicts of interest

# PHASE 2 EVIDENCE

## P2-001: SCIENTIST VALIDATION KEY — The Isotopic Signature

**Target:** All → Scientists (Oscar, Maya, Cara, Juliette, Morty, Chris, Deniz)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Multiple  
**Event Date:** [CLASSIFIED]  
**Source:** Joint Technical Analysis — Need-to-Know Only

**Backstory:**
You've obtained a technical readout describing a unique isotopic signature found in recovered materials. The ratio of magnesium-26 to magnesium-24 is 4:1 — impossible through natural processes or known manufacturing. This signature has been found in samples from THREE separate recovery sites.

**Supporting Intel:**
The signature matches: (1) K-7-ECHO from Kapustin Yar (Oscar's lab), (2) samples in Dr. Juliette Wang's suppressed report, and (3) debris analyzed by American contractors (Maya Badman's DOE program). If someone mentions materials with "impossible" properties, YOU can confirm they're describing the same phenomenon.

**Takeaways:**

- You can VALIDATE claims about anomalous materials
- Three countries have recovered the same type of debris
- Anyone describing "impossible isotopic ratios" is telling the truth
- Use this knowledge carefully — it proves the technology is real

## P2-002: SCIENTIST VALIDATION KEY — The Propulsion Anomaly

**Target:** All → Scientists (Oscar, Maya, Cara, Juliette, Morty, Chris, Deniz)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Multiple  
**Event Date:** [CLASSIFIED]  
**Source:** Classified Research Summary — Eyes Only

**Backstory:**
Your research has confirmed a theoretical framework for inertial mass reduction. When specific electromagnetic frequencies are applied to metamaterials containing the anomalous isotope, objects exhibit reduced gravitational interaction. You've seen the math. It works. Barely.

**Supporting Intel:**
This matches descriptions from Sofia Chen's propulsion program, Roberto De La Torres's encounter reports, and theoretical work by Morty Qiao. If someone describes silent, hovering vehicles with impossible acceleration, they're not lying — you've seen the equations that explain it.

**Takeaways:**

- You can VALIDATE claims about exotic propulsion
- The technology is REAL but poorly understood
- Multiple countries are working on the same problem
- Cooperation might actually solve it faster

## P2-003: The Defector's Testimony

**Target:** US → All Archetypes  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Russia  
**Event Date:** December 1, 2024  
**Source:** CIA Debriefing Transcript — Defector "NORTHWIND"

**Backstory:**
A Russian scientist defected through Finland last month. In debriefing, he described working at a facility where "we studied things that didn't come from Earth." He named Admiral Diego Kuznetsov as someone who oversees the program and claimed the US and Russia have been secretly sharing information "at the highest levels" since 1972.

**Supporting Intel:**
NORTHWIND provided technical details that have been partially verified by Dr. Maya Badman's team. He also claimed a Chinese scientist — matching Morty Qiao's description — was about to defect with even more sensitive information but "disappeared" before making contact.

**Takeaways:**

- US and Russia have been secretly cooperating for 50+ years
- Morty Qiao tried to defect? Or someone similar?
- Admiral Kuznetsov knows the full Russian program
- NORTHWIND's identity must be protected

## P2-004: The Photograph

**Target:** China → Spies (Kevin, Sofia, Hannah, Mitchell)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** unknown  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** October 2024  
**Source:** Intercepted American Intelligence Package

**Backstory:**
MSS intercepted an intelligence package being couriered to the US Embassy in Beijing. It contained a photograph of a Russian and American official shaking hands inside what appears to be a hangar. Behind them is a disc-shaped object approximately 10 meters in diameter. The photograph is undated.

**Supporting Intel:**
The Russian official has been tentatively identified as Jack Kadyrov. The American appears to be Kassidy Neville. If this photograph is authentic, it proves secret US-Russia collaboration on recovered technology — and China has been excluded.

**Takeaways:**

- US and Russia may be secretly allied
- China has been deliberately cut out
- Jack Kadyrov and Kassidy Neville are in this photograph
- Is this real, or disinformation designed to fracture trust?

## P2-005: Dr. Oscar Morozov's Exposure

**Target:** Player → Oscar (Individual)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** Russia  
**Event Date:** Ongoing  
**Source:** Medical Records — Obtained Unofficially

**Backstory:**
Medical records confirm that Dr. Oscar Morozov has been receiving treatment for symptoms consistent with exposure to high-energy electromagnetic fields — the same type theorized to be produced by anomalous propulsion systems. His condition is stable but progressive.

**Supporting Intel:**
Dr. Chris Smirnov has similar symptoms from his time as a cosmonaut — symptoms that were never fully explained. The Ministry of Defense has classified all related medical information. Someone wanted Oscar to know his time may be limited.

**Takeaways:**

- Working on this technology is dangerous
- The government is hiding health impacts
- Dr. Chris Smirnov may understand what's happening to you
- This knowledge should motivate disclosure, not secrecy

## P2-006: The Accountant's Ledger

**Target:** All → Executives (Kassidy, Jack, Hannah)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** 2018-2024  
**Source:** Whistleblower Document — Financial Records

**Backstory:**
A former accountant at a major defense contractor provided a ledger showing payments to officials in all three blocs. The payments are disguised as "consulting fees" but the timing correlates with key policy decisions that benefited the contractor's black programs.

**Supporting Intel:**
The ledger includes codenames: "WINTER BEAR" (Russian), "JADE EMPEROR" (Chinese), and "POTOMAC" (American). Each received between $2-5 million over six years. The accountant fled to a non-extradition country after copying the files. Analysis suggests: WINTER BEAR = Jack Kadyrov, JADE EMPEROR = Hannah Huang, POTOMAC = Rep. Sarah Fierce.

**Takeaways:**

- Officials in ALL THREE blocs are being bribed
- Defense contractors are running the show
- Jack Kadyrov, Hannah Huang, and Sarah Fierce may be compromised
- Who is WINTER BEAR? JADE EMPEROR? POTOMAC?

## P2-007: The Submarine Incident

**Target:** All → Military (Chris, Roberto, Diego, Kannon, Perry)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Norway  
**Event Date:** September 3, 2024  
**Source:** NATO Intelligence Summary — Restricted

**Backstory:**
A Norwegian submarine tracked an unidentified submerged object moving at over 400 knots — far beyond any known vessel. The object appeared to be following a Russian submarine before veering toward a US carrier group. All three navies observed it. None engaged. None can explain it.

**Supporting Intel:**
Captain Perry Sun's patrol squadron reported a similar object in the South China Sea two weeks later. Cmdr. Roberto De La Torres reviewed the footage and said, "That's not ours, and it's not theirs." Admiral Kannon Zhou ordered the Chinese encounter classified at the highest level.

**Takeaways:**

- Something is operating in our oceans
- It's not Russian, American, or Chinese
- All three militaries are covering it up together
- Roberto and Perry both witnessed this — what did they see?

## P2-008: The Burned Agent

**Target:** Russia → Spies (Maddie)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** January 2025  
**Source:** GRU Counterintelligence — Flash Traffic

**Backstory:**
An American operative was caught attempting to recruit Dr. Chris Smirnov. During interrogation, he revealed the existence of a program called "COSMIC CLEARANCE" — a classification level above Top Secret that specifically deals with non-human technology. He claimed only 87 people in the US government have this clearance.

**Supporting Intel:**
The operative mentioned that his handler was "a woman who presents as a socialite but has GRU training." This matches Maddie Volkov's profile exactly. Before the exchange, he allegedly told his interrogators: "You're all fighting over scraps. None of you have the full picture. Find the Chinese — they have a piece you need."

**Takeaways:**

- COSMIC CLEARANCE exists — ask Americans about it
- Only 87 people know the full US program
- The Chinese have something critical
- Maddie Volkov may be blown

**Target:** US → Politicians (Bernardo, Maria)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** Japan  
**Event Date:** December 12, 2024  
**Source:** Japanese Intelligence Tip — Unofficial Channel

**Backstory:**
Japanese intelligence observed Chinese Vice Minister Julia Ren meeting secretly with Eliza Karimov in Osaka. The meeting was held at a private residence owned by a Japanese tech billionaire known for his interest in "exotic aerospace." The meeting lasted four hours.

**Supporting Intel:**
The Japanese source believes China and Russia are negotiating a technology-sharing agreement that would exclude the United States. The phrase "American arrogance" was allegedly overheard. Japan is concerned about being left out of any arrangement.

**Takeaways:**

- China and Russia may be forming an alliance
- Julia Ren and Eliza Karimov are negotiating
- Japan knows more than they're sharing officially
- The US might be getting played

## P2-010: Roberto De La Torres's Confession

**Target:** All Players  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** shareable_if_pressed  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** November 2024  
**Source:** Private Recording — Authenticated

**Backstory:**
Cmdr. Roberto De La Torres recorded a private statement before this conference. He described multiple encounters during his Navy career: "I've seen things that shouldn't exist. Craft that moved in ways that broke physics. I reported through proper channels. Nothing happened. The same objects kept appearing."

**Supporting Intel:**
Roberto's service record is impeccable. He's not a "conspiracy guy." His testimony is being quietly circulated among congressional staffers. Rep. Maria St. Germain has heard the recording. Roberto is prepared to testify publicly if asked.

**Takeaways:**

- A highly credible military officer is ready to talk
- Multiple encounters over years, all suppressed
- Congressional interest is growing
- Roberto De La Torres could blow this open

## P2-011: Harrison Petrov's Drunk Broadcast

**Target:** All Players  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** shareable_if_pressed  
**Origin Country:** Russia  
**Event Date:** December 2024  
**Source:** Rossiya 1 Outtake — Leaked

**Backstory:**
State television executive Harrison Petrov was recording promos when he apparently didn't realize the feed was still live to a satellite uplink. He was heard saying: "The Americans have three! We have two! The Chinese have five but they're all broken! This is why nobody can agree on anything!"

**Supporting Intel:**
The clip was briefly available on a Telegram channel before being scrubbed. Multiple people recorded it. Harrison claims it was "performance art" for a drama series. Eliza Karimov has been assigned to manage the fallout.

**Takeaways:**

- Craft count: US (3), Russia (2), China (5 but damaged)
- Harrison Petrov knows more than a TV executive should
- State media may be briefed on the cover-up
- Someone should ask Harrison what else he knows

## P2-012: The Intern's Discovery

**Target:** US → All  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** 2024  
**Source:** Pentagon Security Incident Report

**Backstory:**
A Pentagon intern accidentally accessed a classified database while trying to find the cafeteria menu. Before being escorted from the building, they saw a file labeled "NON-TERRESTRIAL OFFICERS" and a budget line for "OFF-WORLD ASSETS." The intern has signed 47 NDAs and now works at a Starbucks in Montana.

**Supporting Intel:**
Lt. Chris Ries was the officer who handled the incident. The database name was "COSMIC PERSONNEL." This matches the "COSMIC CLEARANCE" mentioned by the captured American operative. "Non-terrestrial officers" suggests either off-planet personnel or... something else entirely.

**Takeaways:**

- Even the bureaucracy can't keep secrets
- "Non-terrestrial officers" suggests an exchange program
- Chris Ries knows about this incident
- The intern might remember more details

**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** suspected  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** Ongoing  
**Source:** Anonymous Tip

**Backstory:**
Someone has been feeding Maggie Maple classified information about all three nations' programs. Her podcast has been "accidentally" accurate too many times. Intelligence agencies are trying to identify her source. The information appears to come from someone with access to all three blocs.

**Supporting Intel:**
The source signs their messages "CONVERGENCE." They've predicted three major developments before they happened. Either someone has penetrated all three intelligence services, or the source is not human.

**Takeaways:**

- Maggie's source knows everything
- "CONVERGENCE" may be coordinating disclosure
- Intelligence agencies are watching Maggie closely
- Who — or what — is feeding her information?

**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** fabricated  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** China  
**Event Date:** January 2025  
**Source:** MSS Command — Direct Order

**Backstory:**
You have received orders to test the loyalty of Dr. Morty Qiao. MSS believes he may be sympathetic to disclosure and could become a liability. You are to befriend him, earn his trust, and report any statements that suggest disloyalty to the state.

**Supporting Intel:**
If Morty expresses pro-disclosure sentiments or criticizes the government's handling of recovered technology, you are authorized to recommend "containment measures." His scientific value is acknowledged, but national security takes precedence. This order comes from Julia Ren's office.

**Takeaways:**

- You are being ordered to spy on a colleague
- Morty Qiao is under suspicion
- "Containment measures" could mean anything
- Do you follow orders, or do you warn him?

## P2-015: Mitz Albarron's Analysis

**Target:** Player → Mitz (Individual)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** January 2025  
**Source:** RAND Corporation — Classified Assessment

**Backstory:**
Your analysis of global defense postures has revealed an anomaly. All three major powers have been quietly reducing investment in conventional strategic deterrence while increasing spending on "advanced aerospace research." The shift began in 2019 and accelerated after 2021.

**Supporting Intel:**
This pattern only makes sense if all three nations believe conventional military competition is becoming irrelevant. Something has changed the strategic calculus. Your report was classified immediately after submission. You were told not to discuss it with anyone.

**Takeaways:**

- All three powers are pivoting away from conventional warfare
- They know something that changes everything
- Someone doesn't want this analysis public
- What happened in 2019 that changed their calculations?

# PHASE 3 EVIDENCE

## P3-001: The Roswell Memo

**Target:** All Players  
**Phase:** 3  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** US  
**Event Date:** July 8, 1947  
**Source:** Majestic-12 Archive — Declassified Fragment

**Backstory:**
A fragment of a 1947 memo has surfaced, apparently from the original Majestic-12 group formed after the Roswell incident. It reads: "Recommendation: Immediate international cooperation rejected. Soviet involvement deemed unacceptable. Decision: Unilateral containment and study. God help us if we're wrong."

**Supporting Intel:**
The memo is signed by someone whose name is redacted but whose position is listed as "Director." Handwritten in the margin: "Revisit in 50 years if no progress." It's been 77 years. There has been minimal progress.

**Takeaways:**

- The decision to exclude other nations was made in 1947
- They knew it might be wrong
- 77 years of secrecy has produced little results
- The original architects are all dead — time to reconsider

## P3-002: The Convergence Protocol

**Target:** All → Politicians (Bernardo, Maria, Sarah, Eliza, Jake, Julia, Mitchell)  
**Phase:** 3  
**Legitimacy:** unknown  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Unknown  
**Event Date:** [UNDATED]  
**Source:** Anonymous Diplomatic Pouch — All Three Blocs Received Identical Copies

**Backstory:**
Each bloc received an identical document titled "CONVERGENCE PROTOCOL" through their diplomatic pouches. No one knows who sent it. The document outlines a framework for international cooperation on recovered technology, complete with proposed oversight structures and information-sharing agreements.

**Supporting Intel:**
The document demonstrates detailed knowledge of ALL THREE blocs' programs — information no single country should have. Either someone has penetrated all three, or... the source is not from any government. The document ends with: "You are not alone, and you are running out of time."

**Takeaways:**

- Someone knows everything about all programs
- They want cooperation
- The timeline warning suggests external pressure
- This is signed "CONVERGENCE" — same as Maggie's source

**Event Date:** January 2025  
**Source:** Combined Intelligence Assessment

**Backstory:**
Intelligence analysts from all three blocs, working secretly together, have concluded: "The technology we've recovered is defensive in nature. The craft show evidence of damage consistent with weapons fire. Implication: there is a threat these vehicles were designed to counter. We don't know what that threat is. But if they needed protection, so do we."

**Supporting Intel:**
Recovered craft show battle damage. Some contain what appear to be emergency distress systems. The technology wasn't given to us — it crashed here, possibly fleeing something. Our petty rivalries are irrelevant if we're all facing the same fate.

**Takeaways:**

- The craft were running from something
- There's a bigger threat we don't understand
- Competition is suicide; cooperation is survival
- The game just changed

## P3-004: Scientist Consensus Document

**Target:** All → Scientists (Oscar, Maya, Cara, Juliette, Morty, Chris, Deniz)  
**Phase:** 3  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** confidential  
**Origin Country:** Multiple  
**Event Date:** January 2025  
**Source:** Informal Scientific Working Group

**Backstory:**
Scientists from all three programs, communicating through back channels, have drafted a consensus statement: "No single nation's research has achieved propulsion breakthrough. Combined, our data might. Continued secrecy guarantees collective failure. We, the undersigned, recommend immediate scientific cooperation under international oversight."

**Supporting Intel:**
Dr. Maya Badman, Dr. Oscar Morozov, and Dr. Morty Qiao are among the signatories. Dr. Chris Smirnov provided crucial theoretical insights. They're risking everything because they believe the alternative — continued secrecy — is extinction.

**Takeaways:**

- Scientists across all blocs agree: cooperation is necessary
- The data must be combined to succeed
- Signing this is career suicide — they did it anyway
- The politicians need to catch up to the scientists

## P3-005: The Ultimatum

**Target:** All → Executives (Kassidy, Jack, Hannah)  
**Phase:** 3  
**Legitimacy:** unknown  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret  
**Origin Country:** Unknown  
**Event Date:** January 2025  
**Source:** Secure Channel — Origin Unknown

**Backstory:**
Executives at defense contractors in all three blocs received the same message: "Your programs will be exposed in 90 days regardless of your cooperation. You can manage disclosure, or it will manage you. We recommend you begin preparing your governments. The choice is yours, but the timeline is not."

**Supporting Intel:**
Kassidy Neville, Jack Kadyrov, and Hannah Huang all received this message simultaneously. No one knows who sent it. It arrived through classified channels that should be impenetrable. The implication is clear: someone with extraordinary access is forcing the issue.

**Takeaways:**

- Someone is forcing disclosure on a 90-day timeline
- Contractors are preparing for exposure
- Governments will be blamed for the cover-up
- Get ahead of this or be buried by it

**Target:** Player → Sarah (Individual)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** confidential

**Backstory:**
Your Lockheed Martin stock options are worth $4.7 million — and they're tied to black program contracts you voted to fund while in Congress. If the programs are exposed, the stocks become worthless. If disclosure happens, you're ruined. Financially and politically.

**Takeaways:**

- You have $4.7 million reasons to keep secrets
- Senator Reis has been asking questions about your votes
- Choose: your portfolio or your conscience

**Legitimacy:** unknown  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret

**Backstory:**
Someone slipped a note under your door last night: "Kevin Zhang has orders to test your loyalty. They're watching. Be careful who you trust." The handwriting matches nothing in your files. The paper is from a brand only sold in the United States.

**Takeaways:**

- You're being surveilled by your own side
- Someone American is warning you — why?

**Target:** Player → Perry (Individual)  
**Phase:** 2  
**Legitimacy:** verified  
**Confidentiality:** top_secret

**Backstory:**
Your official patrol report says nothing unusual happened on September 17th. But your personal log tells a different story: a 40-minute encounter with an object that descended from 40,000 feet to sea level in under 3 seconds, hovered 100 meters from your aircraft, and departed at speeds your instruments couldn't measure.

**Takeaways:**

- You witnessed something impossible
- Roberto De La Torres had a similar encounter
- If you both testify together, they can't dismiss it
- Your official report is a lie — and they made you sign it

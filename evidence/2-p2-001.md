Title:
SCIENTIST VALIDATION KEY — The Isotopic Signature

Origin:
Multiple

Date:
[CLASSIFIED]

Summary:
You've obtained a technical readout describing a unique isotopic signature found in recovered materials. The ratio of magnesium-26 to magnesium-24 is 4:1 — impossible through natural processes or known manufacturing. This signature has been found in samples from THREE separate recovery sites.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Source:
Joint Technical Analysis — Need-to-Know Only

SUPPORTING INTEL

The signature matches: (1) K-7-ECHO from Kapustin Yar (Oscar's lab), (2) samples in Dr. Juliette Wang's suppressed report, and (3) debris analyzed by American contractors (Maya Badman's DOE program). If someone mentions materials with "impossible" properties, YOU can confirm they're describing the same phenomenon.

TAKEAWAYS

1. You can VALIDATE claims about anomalous materials
2. Three countries have recovered the same type of debris
3. Anyone describing "impossible isotopic ratios" is telling the truth
4. Use this knowledge carefully — it proves the technology is real

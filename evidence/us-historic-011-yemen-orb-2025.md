Title:
Yemen Orb Incident — A Metallic Sphere Films a U.S. Airstrike (And Doesn't Flinch)

Origin:
U.S. Navy / U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)

Date:
February 2025

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Multiple Navy personnel went on record, and the video exists.

During U.S. military operations against Houthi targets in Yemen, a Navy weapons systems operator captured a **metallic, spherical object** hovering near an active airstrike.

The object was recorded via FLIR maintaining a **fixed position** approximately 2,000 feet from the impact zone — completely unbothered by shockwaves, debris, or U.S. aircraft activity.

**What makes this special:**

1. **Stationary hover during combat operations**: The orb didn't move despite being right next to explosions
2. **No visible propulsion**: No heat signature, no rotors, no exhaust — it just floated there
3. **Perfect spherical geometry**: Not a balloon, not a drone — a precise metallic sphere
4. **Active intelligence interest**: The object appeared to be **observing** the military operation

Navy personnel reported the incident. CENTCOM's response: "We're aware of objects in the battlespace. Continue operations."

That's military speak for "yeah, we know, we've seen them before, don't worry about it."

Confidence: HIGH

SUPPORTING INTEL

**This incident fits a pattern:**

- **Metallic orbs are the most common UAP reported by military personnel** — roughly 50% of sightings in the AARO database
- Similar orbs observed near **every major U.S. military operation** for the past two decades
- Orbs documented over Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and now Yemen
- In one Afghanistan incident, an orb was **struck by a surface-to-air missile and was undamaged**

**What this suggests:**

1. Someone or something is monitoring U.S. military operations globally
2. The objects demonstrate technology far beyond our most advanced surveillance drones
3. The military has normalized this — pilots are told to just keep flying
4. Despite active combat zones with extensive air defense, **no orb has ever been shot down or recovered**

Former intelligence officials describe these orbs as showing "clear intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) behavior patterns" — but ISR for whom?

TAKEAWAYS

1. **UAPs are actively monitoring U.S. military combat operations** — this isn't speculation, it's documented
2. The military's blasé response ("continue operations") suggests this is commonplace — they've accepted they can't do anything about it
3. If any adversary nation had surveillance tech this advanced, the geopolitical implications would be catastrophic — but no nation claims it
4. These objects appear indestructible by conventional weapons — think about what that means for national defense

SUPPORTING INTEL

Three individuals are under suspicion. One is described as "having recent unexplained travel to European capitals." Another "has family connections to a foreign government." Analysis suggests the mole may not be American at all, but an asset who turned. One suspect matches the profile of someone at a D.C. think tank with intelligence connections.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Someone in the US delegation is leaking
2. Project LOOKING GLASS is real and sensitive
3. Watch for anyone with "European travel" or "family connections abroad"
4. The mole might be Brea Balloon — or someone using her as cover

Title:
Trans-Medium Travel — These Things Go Air-to-Water Like It's Nothing

Origin:
Global / Multiple Observations

Date:
Various (1950s-Present)

Summary:
**THIS IS REPEATEDLY DOCUMENTED.** Objects transition between air and water without slowing down — something physics says shouldn't be possible.

**Aguadilla, Puerto Rico (2013)**: U.S. Customs thermal imaging captured an object traveling 100+ mph that **entered the ocean**, traveled underwater, **exited**, and continued flying — without transition effects. It then **split into two objects**.

**USS Omaha (2019)**: Navy radar tracked a spherical object flying, then **descending into water** and disappearing. No wreckage found.

Multiple Navy pilots report objects emerging from the ocean or plunging beneath the surface at high speed. Water is 800 times denser than air — transitioning at speed should cause catastrophic forces. These objects don't seem to notice.

Confidence: HIGH

Source:
U.S. Customs and Border Protection thermal footage, Navy radar data, pilot testimonies, Congressional briefings

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why this matters:**

No known human technology can operate trans-medium. The engineering challenges are insurmountable: drag, pressure, propulsion systems incompatible between mediums, transition forces that should destroy any craft.

**The Navy connection:**

The U.S. Navy's Pais patents describe a "Hybrid Aerospace-Underwater Craft" using inertial mass reduction. Did they invent it, or have they seen it?

**Underwater activity:**

Sailors and submarine crews report objects moving underwater at impossible speeds (hundreds of knots) and sonar contacts ascending into the air. Puerto Rico appears to be a hotspot, possibly due to the deep trench and military presence.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Trans-medium travel is consistently reported — objects move between air and water without transition effects
2. This eliminates all conventional aircraft, drones, and known technology from consideration
3. Whoever possesses this capability has an insurmountable strategic advantage

Title:
China's 2025 UFO Wave — Something Is Happening in Chinese Skies

Origin:
People's Republic of China

Date:
January-September 2025

Summary:
**THIS IS HAPPENING NOW.** In 2025, China experienced an unprecedented wave of mass UFO sightings that authorities couldn't suppress.

Between January and September 2025, at least **20 credible mass-witness UFO events** have been documented across China. These aren't isolated reports — they're incidents with hundreds or thousands of witnesses, video evidence, and in some cases official acknowledgment.

**February 10-18, Fujian Province (Zhangzhou):**
Multiple orbs plus **saucer-shaped craft** exhibiting "**cloning behavior**" — a single object splitting into parallel formations, then recombining. Objects disappeared and reappeared, illuminating clouds from below. **800+ social media engagements**, TV news coverage, **100+ witnesses**, and local Army confirmed **no military drills** were occurring.

**September 12-13, Shandong Province:**
A "**fireball-like luminous object**" appeared to be **intercepted by missiles** — witnesses saw bright flashes and descent patterns across multiple cities. **1,500+ social media engagement**. Official denial but no prosaic identification provided.

**January 2025, Liaoning Province:**
A "**Merkabah**" (diamond/tetrahedron) shaped craft was filmed — geometric morphology completely inconsistent with any known aircraft.

When thousands of people across a country known for censorship manage to post enough UFO videos that the government can't delete them all, something significant is happening.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why 2025?**

The unprecedented volume of sightings could indicate: **increased activity** (something changed in NHI behavior), **reduced suppression** (Chinese censorship slipping), **technology proliferation** (more cameras = more documentation), **foreign reconnaissance** (advanced drones from adversaries), or **Chinese testing** (domestic advanced technology programs).

**The censorship race:**

In China, sensitive content disappears fast. The fact that so many 2025 videos survived suggests either: authorities were overwhelmed by volume, some events were permitted as "controlled disclosure," or network effects outpaced deletion capability.

**Official responses:**

Chinese authorities have been notably **more communicative** about some 2025 incidents compared to historical cases. Military spokespersons confirmed "no exercises" during several sightings — which is itself a form of admission that something unexplained occurred.

**The Fujian "cloning" incident:**

The behavior described — objects splitting into multiple identical copies that move independently — matches no known technology. This isn't flares, drones, or conventional aircraft. Either witnesses are all lying (across multiple provinces with identical descriptions) or something genuinely anomalous is present.

**Pattern analysis:**

The 2025 wave shows clustering around **major cities** (high-population areas), **coastal regions** (possible correlation with naval/maritime activity), and **industrial zones** (areas with significant military-industrial presence).

**Global context:**

The 2025 Chinese wave coincides with increased UAP reporting in the United States, European airport disruptions (drone swarms), and Middle East military encounters (Yemen orbs). Something global may be occurring.

TAKEAWAYS

1. China is experiencing a major UFO wave in 2025 that has overwhelmed normal censorship — indicating either genuine mass phenomena or a deliberate change in information policy
2. Witness descriptions of object behavior (splitting, recombining, geometric morphologies) exceed conventional technology explanations
3. The simultaneous global increase in sightings suggests we may be entering a new phase of the phenomenon — whatever that means for humanity

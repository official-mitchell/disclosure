SUPPORTING INTEL

The ledger includes codenames: "WINTER BEAR" (Russian), "JADE EMPEROR" (Chinese), and "POTOMAC" (American). Each received between $2-5 million over six years. The accountant fled to a non-extradition country after copying the files. Analysis suggests: WINTER BEAR = Jack Kadyrov, JADE EMPEROR = Hannah Huang, POTOMAC = Rep. Sarah Fierce.

Summary:
Intelligence analysts from all three blocs, working secretly together, have concluded: "The technology we've recovered is defensive in nature. The craft show evidence of damage consistent with weapons fire. Implication: there is a threat these vehicles were designed to counter. We don't know what that threat is. But if they needed protection, so do we."

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

Recovered craft show battle damage. Some contain what appear to be emergency distress systems. The technology wasn't given to us — it crashed here, possibly fleeing something. Our petty rivalries are irrelevant if we're all facing the same fate.

TAKEAWAYS

1. The craft were running from something
2. There's a bigger threat we don't understand
3. Competition is suicide; cooperation is survival
4. The game just changed

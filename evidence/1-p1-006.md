Summary:
A letter arrived at the Senate Intelligence Committee claiming that Northrop Grumman has been running a "legacy recovery program" since 1961. The letter alleges the company possesses "three intact vehicles of non-human origin" and has spent $14 billion in black budget funds reverse-engineering them — with minimal success.

The letter included a photograph of what appears to be a warehouse interior with a disc-shaped object under a tarp. Metadata analysis was inconclusive. The letter was signed "A Patriot Who Has Seen Enough." Rep. Maria St. Germain has been quietly asking questions about Kassidy Neville's program portfolio.

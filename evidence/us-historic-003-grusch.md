Title:
David Grusch Testimony — The Whistleblower Who Said "Crash Retrievals Are Real"

Origin:
United States Congress

Date:
July 26, 2023

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Under oath. On live television. In front of Congress.

David Grusch isn't some guy with a blog. He was a **decorated intelligence officer** at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and served as the representative to the UAP Task Force. He held **Top Secret/SCI clearance** — the highest level. He briefed Congress. He knew where the bodies were buried.

And then he said this, under penalty of perjury:

The U.S. government has been running **multi-decade crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs**. We have recovered **"non-human spacecraft."** We have recovered **"non-human biologics"** — which is government-speak for alien bodies.

He testified that **defense contractors** (think: Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing) have been hiding this technology from Congress. That people who've tried to access these programs have been **"brutally administratively attacked."** That he himself received **death threats** after coming forward.

**The simple version**: A guy who used to brief the President's intelligence team went on national TV and said "aliens are real, we have their stuff, and people have been murdered to keep it secret."

Congress's reaction? They didn't laugh him out of the room. They started writing legislation.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why should you believe him?**

1. **Inspector General validated his complaint**: The IC Inspector General found his claims "**credible and urgent**" — that's not language they use lightly
2. **30+ additional whistleblowers**: Grusch isn't alone. Dozens more have provided classified testimony to Congress
3. **He's not selling anything**: Unlike some UFO personalities, Grusch isn't hawking books or documentaries. He's a career intelligence officer who risked everything
4. **Congressional reaction**: Senators who've received classified briefings have called the information "**shocking**" and "**sobering**"

**What he specifically alleged:**

- Crash retrievals dating back to the 1930s (yes, before Roswell)
- "Non-human intelligence" origin of recovered craft
- Illegal funding mechanisms hiding programs from oversight
- Physical intimidation and career destruction of potential whistleblowers
- Knowledge of "non-human biologics" recovered from crash sites

**The Wilson-Davis Memo connection**: Grusch's testimony aligns with leaked 2002 notes suggesting a Vice Admiral was denied access to a crash retrieval program run by defense contractors. The memo describes craft of "off-world" origin.

TAKEAWAYS

1. A credentialed intelligence officer testified under oath that the U.S. government possesses non-human spacecraft and biological remains
2. Congressional leadership has seen classified evidence that made them take this seriously enough to draft unprecedented disclosure legislation
3. If even 10% of what Grusch said is true, we're living through the biggest cover-up in human history

Title:
David Grusch Testimony — The Whistleblower Who Said "Crash Retrievals Are Real"

Origin:
United States Congress

Date:
July 26, 2023

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Under oath. On live television. In front of Congress.

David Grusch was a **decorated intelligence officer** at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, representative to the UAP Task Force, held **Top Secret/SCI clearance**, briefed Congress.

Under penalty of perjury, he testified:

The U.S. government has been running **multi-decade crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs**. We have recovered **"non-human spacecraft"** and **"non-human biologics"** (government-speak for alien bodies).

**Defense contractors** (Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing) have been hiding this from Congress. People trying to access these programs were **"brutally administratively attacked."** Grusch received **death threats**.

Congress didn't laugh him out of the room. They started writing legislation.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Source:
House Oversight Committee hearing testimony (July 26, 2023), Intelligence Community Inspector General complaint (filed 2022), Congressional record

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why believe him:**

1. **Inspector General validated his complaint** — found claims "**credible and urgent**"
2. **30+ additional whistleblowers** have provided classified testimony to Congress
3. He's not selling anything — career intelligence officer who risked everything
4. Senators who've received classified briefings called information "**shocking**" and "**sobering**"

**What he alleged:**

- Crash retrievals dating back to the 1930s (before Roswell)
- "Non-human intelligence" origin of recovered craft
- Illegal funding mechanisms hiding programs from oversight
- Physical intimidation and career destruction of potential whistleblowers
- Knowledge of "non-human biologics" recovered from crash sites

**Wilson-Davis Memo connection**: Leaked 2002 notes suggest a Vice Admiral was denied access to a crash retrieval program run by defense contractors. The memo describes craft of "off-world" origin.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Credentialed intelligence officer testified under oath that the U.S. government possesses non-human spacecraft and biological remains
2. Congressional leadership has seen classified evidence that made them draft unprecedented disclosure legislation
3. If even 10% of what Grusch said is true, we're living through the biggest cover-up in human history

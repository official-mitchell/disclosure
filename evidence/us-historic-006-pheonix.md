Title:
The Phoenix Lights — When Thousands Saw The Same Thing

Origin:
Arizona, United States

Date:
March 13, 1997

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Thousands of witnesses. Multiple cities. The Governor of Arizona. All saw the same thing.

On March 13, 1997, a **massive V-shaped craft** — witnesses estimated **over a mile wide** — silently glided over Arizona. It passed over Phoenix in full view of thousands.

Witnesses described a **solid, structured object** blocking out the stars. Silent. Slow. Absolutely massive.

**Governor Fife Symington** initially mocked the sightings (brought out a staffer in an alien costume). Years later, he admitted he'd **seen it himself** and called it "otherworldly": "I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything I've ever seen."

The Air Force claimed the lights were **flares dropped from military aircraft**. But witnesses reported two separate events that night, and the massive craft was seen **before** any flares were allegedly dropped. Flares don't fly in formation, block out stars, or stay perfectly still in a V-shape.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

**The timeline problem:**

- **8:15-8:30 PM**: Massive V-shaped craft reported flying south from Nevada through Arizona
- **10:00 PM**: Maryland Air National Guard drops flares over Barry Goldwater Range

The Air Force explanation only covers the 10 PM lights. The earlier, more significant sightings — the actual craft — have never been officially addressed.

**Witness credibility:**

- Commercial airline pilots
- Air traffic controllers
- Police officers
- A sitting state Governor
- Thousands of ordinary citizens

**Physical description (consistent):**

- V-shaped or boomerang structure
- Estimated 1-2 miles in width
- 5-7 lights on the underside
- Silent or low humming sound
- Moved slowly, deliberately
- Blocked starlight as it passed (indicating solid structure)

**Cover-up behavior**: When Governor Symington tried to get answers from federal agencies, he was stonewalled: "We just couldn't get any information. The feds wouldn't talk about it."

TAKEAWAYS

1. Thousands of people in a major American city witnessed an object that defies any known aircraft — the government's "flares" explanation doesn't hold up to timeline scrutiny
2. Even a sitting Governor who initially mocked the sightings later admitted he saw something "otherworldly" and couldn't get answers from federal authorities
3. When this many credible witnesses see the same impossible thing, either mass hallucination is real or something was in our skies that shouldn't exist

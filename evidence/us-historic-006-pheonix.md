Title:
The Phoenix Lights — When Thousands Saw The Same Thing

Origin:
Arizona, United States

Date:
March 13, 1997

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Thousands of witnesses. Multiple cities. The Governor of Arizona. All saw the same thing.

On the night of March 13, 1997, a **massive V-shaped craft** — witnesses estimated it at **over a mile wide** — silently glided over the state of Arizona. It passed over Phoenix, one of America's largest cities, in full view of thousands of people.

This wasn't some blurry dot in the sky. Witnesses described a **solid, structured object** blocking out the stars as it passed overhead. Silent. Slow. Absolutely massive.

**Governor Fife Symington** initially mocked the sightings at a press conference (he brought out a staffer in an alien costume — real classy). Years later, he admitted he'd **seen it himself** and called it "otherworldly."

His exact quote: "I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery."

**Simple analogy**: Imagine a flying football stadium cruising over your city at rooftop height, making zero noise, and the government telling you it was "flares." That's Phoenix Lights.

The Air Force later claimed the lights were **flares dropped from military aircraft**. Cool story — except witnesses reported two separate events that night, and the massive craft was seen **before** any flares were allegedly dropped.

Also, flares don't fly in formation. Or block out stars. Or stay perfectly still in a V-shape for extended periods.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**The timeline problem:**

- **8:15-8:30 PM**: Massive V-shaped craft reported flying south from Nevada through Arizona
- **10:00 PM**: Maryland Air National Guard drops flares over Barry Goldwater Range

The Air Force explanation only covers the 10 PM lights. The earlier, more significant sightings — the actual craft — have never been officially addressed.

**Witness credibility:**

- Commercial airline pilots
- Air traffic controllers
- Police officers
- A sitting state Governor
- Thousands of ordinary citizens who all described the same thing

**Physical description (consistent across witnesses):**

- V-shaped or boomerang structure
- Estimated 1-2 miles in width
- 5-7 lights on the underside
- Silent or low humming sound
- Moved slowly, deliberately
- Blocked starlight as it passed (indicating solid structure)

**The cover-up behavior:**
When Governor Symington tried to get answers from federal agencies, he was stonewalled. "We just couldn't get any information," he later said. "The feds wouldn't talk about it."

TAKEAWAYS

1. Thousands of people in a major American city witnessed an object that defies any known aircraft — and the government's "flares" explanation doesn't hold up to basic timeline scrutiny
2. Even a sitting Governor who initially mocked the sightings later admitted he saw something "otherworldly" and couldn't get answers from federal authorities
3. When this many credible witnesses see the same impossible thing, either mass hallucination is real or something was in our skies that shouldn't exist

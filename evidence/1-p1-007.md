Title:
Maddie Volkov's Double Life

Origin:
Russia

Date:
January 5, 2025

Summary:
GRU surveillance has flagged anomalies in Maddie Volkov's communications. Despite her cover as an "arms dealer's wife," she's been observed meeting with individuals who don't appear in any official contact lists. Her encrypted communications show patterns consistent with a secondary handler.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

Maddie's husband Jack Kadyrov believes she's loyal to him. He doesn't know about the Swiss bank account receiving quarterly deposits from a shell company traced to Virginia. She has not been arrested because GRU wants to see who she's feeding — and whether Jack is compromised too.

1. Maddie Volkov may be a double agent
2. The CIA (Virginia) may be running her

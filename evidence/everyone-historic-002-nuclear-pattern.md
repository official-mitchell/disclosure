Title:
UFOs and Nukes — They've Been Watching Our Bombs Since Day One

Origin:
Global / Multiple Countries

Date:
1945-Present

Summary:
**THIS PATTERN IS DOCUMENTED.** Since the first nuclear test in 1945, UAPs have shown persistent interest in nuclear weapons across all nuclear-armed nations for 80 years.

**Malmstrom AFB (1967)**: While a glowing object hovered overhead, **10 ICBMs simultaneously went offline** across different facilities. The Air Force never explained it.

**Soviet ICBM incident**: A UAP hovered over a missile base, then **spontaneously entered launch codes**. The missiles nearly fired.

The pattern spans U.S., Soviet/Russian, British, French, Indian, Pakistani, and Israeli nuclear facilities. Too consistent to be coincidence.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

Multiple military testimonies, declassified documents, international incident reports, Robert Hastings research ("UFOs and Nukes")

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Why nuclear sites?**

Theories range from benevolent (preventing accidents) to concerning (mapping defenses). What's clear: UAPs can **act** on nuclear systems, not just observe — disabling missiles, interrupting launches, jamming communications.

**International pattern:**

The nuclear-interest pattern spans all nuclear states — democratic and authoritarian, NATO and Warsaw Pact. Activity spikes during weapons testing, military exercises, and international tensions. They monitor changes in nuclear posture.

TAKEAWAYS

1. UAP interest in nuclear weapons spans 80 years across all nuclear-armed nations — too consistent to be coincidence
2. These objects can disable nuclear systems at will — they're not just watching, they can act
3. Humanity's most dangerous weapons may not be as controlled as we thought

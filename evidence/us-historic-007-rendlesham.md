Title:
Rendlesham Forest — The "British Roswell" at a U.S. Nuclear Base

Origin:
United Kingdom / United States Air Force

Date:
December 26-28, 1980

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** U.S. Air Force personnel. A NATO nuclear weapons base. Three nights of close encounters. Radiation traces left behind.

Over three nights in December 1980, multiple U.S. Air Force security personnel at RAF Woodbridge/Bentwaters (a base storing **nuclear weapons**) encountered something in Rendlesham Forest.

**Night 1**: Security police spotted lights. Deputy Base Commander **Lt. Col. Charles Halt** investigated. They found a triangular craft with **hieroglyphic-like symbols** on its side, pulsing with colored lights.

**Night 2**: The craft returned. Lt. Col. Halt recorded his observations on tape — real-time audio of a decorated military officer watching something impossible.

**Night 3**: Airman First Class **John Burroughs** approached the craft closely. He later developed serious health issues. The VA initially refused treatment — until a classified document confirmed **radiation exposure**.

The U.S. government quietly paid for his medical treatment through a program that doesn't officially exist for an incident that didn't officially happen.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Physical evidence:**

- **Indentations in the ground**: Three depressions in a triangular pattern where witnesses said the craft landed
- **Radiation readings**: Beta/gamma radiation levels at the landing site measured **25x normal background levels**
- **Broken tree branches**: Snap pattern consistent with something large descending through the canopy
- **Soil analysis**: Anomalous readings in the landing zone

**Lt. Col. Halt's memo:**

"A red sun-like light was seen through the trees. It moved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off glowing particles and then broke into five separate white objects and then disappeared. Immediately thereafter, three star-like objects were noticed in the sky... The object to the south was visible for two or three hours and beamed down a stream of light from time to time."

**He sent this memo to the UK Ministry of Defence** — an official report from a base commander about a security breach at a nuclear weapons facility.

**Why this matters**: Multiple nuclear-armed facilities have reported similar intrusions. Whatever these objects are, they seem particularly interested in our most dangerous weapons.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Dozens of U.S. military personnel at a nuclear weapons base had a close encounter that left physical evidence, radiation traces, and required classified medical treatment
2. The incident was documented in real-time by a Lt. Colonel and reported through official channels — this isn't hearsay
3. Something has been visiting our nuclear facilities for decades, and governments on both sides of the Atlantic have covered it up

SUPPORTING INTEL

Varginha, Brazil was the site of an alleged UFO incident in 1996. The Brazilian military has always denied involvement. This intercept suggests materials were recovered and that an American military officer has shown interest. Travel records show Cmdr. Roberto De La Torres was in São Paulo during the relevant timeframe.

TAKEAWAYS

1. Someone from US military visited Brazil recently
2. Russians are tracking American movements
3. "Varginha materials" are real and contested
4. Roberto De La Torres may know more than he's saying

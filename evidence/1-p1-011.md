Admiral Diego Kuznetsov was observed drinking heavily at a diplomatic reception in Geneva.

But the Chinese — they're actually making progress."

Diego was escorted out by his security detail shortly after. The next day, Eliza Karimov was dispatched to "manage the situation." His current status is under review. The American diplomat who heard this has been instructed not to discuss it.

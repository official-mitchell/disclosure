Title:
The PLA's AI UFO Program — China Is Using Artificial Intelligence to Track Them

Origin:
People's Liberation Army Air Force

Date:
2019-Present

Summary:
**THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.** China's military has so many UFO reports that they need AI to analyze them all.

In 2019, **Chen Li**, a researcher at the PLA Air Force Early Warning Academy, revealed that China's military is using **artificial intelligence** to process and analyze UAP reports. The volume of data is apparently too massive for human analysts alone.

Think about what that means: China is seeing so many unidentified objects that they built computer systems specifically to handle the workload.

The PLA terms these objects "**Unidentified Air Conditions**" — a sterile, bureaucratic label for something extraordinary. But the resources being dedicated tell a different story.

**Why AI?**

- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying characteristics across thousands of reports
- **Predictive modeling**: Anticipating where/when objects might appear
- **Correlation analysis**: Linking sightings to other events (military exercises, nuclear tests, etc.)
- **Data management**: Organizing decades of accumulated observations

China's approach is notably **empirical** — they're collecting data, running statistics, and building models. Less interested in witnesses' feelings, more interested in measurable phenomena.

SUPPORTING INTEL

**What this tells us:**

If China is investing in AI-assisted UAP analysis, they're seeing: **high volume** (too many incidents for manual processing), **persistent patterns** (enough consistency to justify systematic study), and **strategic relevance** (military leadership considers this worth resources).

**The Chinese Academy of Sciences approach:**

China's scientific establishment has been surprisingly open about UAP research compared to their military. Dr. Wang Sichao, a prominent astronomer, developed frameworks using regression analysis on sighting data to quantify anomalous flight characteristics. This is serious methodology, not tabloid speculation.

**Technology development:**

Reports indicate China has developed **drones that mimic UAP signatures** — craft designed to test VTOL capabilities and stealth characteristics observed in genuine sightings. This suggests they're not just studying — they're attempting to **replicate** what they've observed.

**The secrecy gap:**

Unlike the U.S., China has no civilian reporting infrastructure, no freedom of information laws, no whistleblower protections, and total state control over media. Any information that emerges comes either through official channels (rare) or defectors (dangerous). What we know is almost certainly a fraction of what exists.

**Comparison to U.S. programs:**

The PLA's AI-assisted analysis parallels allegations about **"Immaculate Constellation"** — a purported U.S. program that allegedly uses AI to route UAP sensor data into classified compartments. Both superpowers may have independently arrived at the same technological solution.

TAKEAWAYS

1. China's military is experiencing enough UAP activity that they've deployed AI systems specifically to analyze it — this is not a country that wastes resources on nonsense
2. The PLA's empirical, data-driven approach suggests they're treating this as a legitimate technological/intelligence challenge, not a psychological phenomenon
3. China's information control means we're seeing only what they allow — their actual knowledge and activities are almost certainly far more extensive

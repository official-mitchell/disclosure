Title:
IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION — The Secret UAP Program Hidden Inside the Pentagon

Origin:
U.S. Department of Defense (Unacknowledged Special Access Program)

Date:
Existence alleged October 2024

Summary:
**THIS IS ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED.** A congressional whistleblower provided this information under oath.

In October 2024, a **new whistleblower** came forward to the House Oversight Committee: there exists a **highly classified program** called "IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION" that has been collecting UAP imagery and intelligence **for decades** — completely hidden from Congressional oversight.

According to the whistleblower (identity protected), this program:

- Operates under a **Special Access Program (SAP)** so compartmented that most Pentagon leadership doesn't know it exists
- Has collected **extensive photographic and video evidence** of UAPs, including clear imagery far exceeding anything publicly released
- Maintains a database of encounters that dwarfs officially acknowledged numbers
- Is connected to the **crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs** David Grusch testified about

The name "Immaculate Constellation" suggests either a religious undertone or refers to a constellation of sensors/platforms. Intelligence naming conventions usually mean something.

Congress demanded answers. The Pentagon's response: "We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program." Government-speak for "yes, it exists, but we're not telling you about it."

Confidence: ALLEGED (unverified but sworn testimony)

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Legal implications:**

- If true, this program has been illegally hidden from Congress for decades
- The "Gang of Eight" (top Congressional intelligence officials) claim they were never briefed
- This would violate multiple federal laws requiring Congressional notification of SAPs

**What the program allegedly contains:**

- High-resolution imagery of UAPs from satellite, aircraft, and ground-based sensors
- Detailed technical analysis of observed flight characteristics
- Encounter reports from military personnel across all service branches
- Possible coordination documents with allied nations' similar programs

**Connections to other programs:**

- Whistleblowers suggest IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION is the "mothership" program
- Other alleged programs (crash retrieval, reverse engineering) may feed into it
- Some believe the Navy's UAP Task Force was a "limited hangout" — partial disclosure to distract from the real program

Congressional investigators noted that whenever they request UAP-related documents, they receive either nothing or heavily redacted materials. This aligns with the allegation that the real information is held in a program they don't have access to.

TAKEAWAYS

1. **If true, the U.S. government has been lying to Congress** about the extent of UAP evidence for decades — that's a constitutional crisis
2. The classification structure has been weaponized to hide information from oversight — exactly what Grusch alleged
3. Someone inside the system believes this information is important enough to risk their career (and freedom) to disclose
4. The Pentagon's non-denial denial strongly suggests there's something to this
5. The pattern is consistent: compartmentalization, obfuscation, and denial — until it becomes undeniable

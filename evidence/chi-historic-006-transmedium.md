Title:
China's Trans-Medium Patent — They Put "UFO Technology" in a Government Filing

Origin:
China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) / PLA Navy

Date:
Patent filed 2017, Granted 2019

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** China filed and was granted a patent for a craft that can operate in air, water, and space. Sound familiar?

In 2017, engineers associated with the **People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)** filed a patent for a "**cross-media aircraft**" — a vehicle specifically designed to transition seamlessly between atmospheric flight, underwater operation, and near-space environments.

The patent (CN107963921A) describes: a disc-shaped or cylindrical craft, capable of **trans-medium travel** (air-to-water-to-space transitions), using "**electromagnetic propulsion**" rather than conventional engines, designed to minimize transitional drag and pressure changes.

**Why this matters:**

1. Patents require some level of technical feasibility — you can't just patent magic
2. The design characteristics **match UAP observables** almost exactly
3. China's military-industrial complex doesn't waste resources on fantasy projects
4. The filing occurred after years of documented Chinese UAP encounters

The craft's described capabilities mirror the "**five observables**" identified in U.S. UAP analysis: instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity, trans-medium travel, low observability, and no visible propulsion.

Either China independently invented UAP technology from scratch, or they're trying to replicate something they've observed. Occam's razor suggests the latter.

Confidence: CONFIRMED (patent exists) / SUSPICIOUS (technology actually feasible?)

SUPPORTING INTEL

**China's trans-medium research history:**

China has been investing heavily in "**cross-domain vehicles**" since at least 2010: multiple university programs studying air-water transition physics, substantial funding for "exotic propulsion" research, documented interest in electromagnetic drive systems (EmDrive), and a hypergravity research facility in Hangzhou (the world's largest).

**Why the patent timing matters:**

2017 was significant: U.S. UAP videos were leaked/released showing trans-medium capability, Chinese military encounters with UAPs were reportedly increasing, the U.S. Navy was filing its own "impossible" patents (Salvatore Pais patents), and global interest in advanced propulsion was spiking.

**Parallel development or reverse engineering?**

The patent describes technology that: has no public theoretical foundation in Chinese scientific literature, would require energy sources that don't officially exist, and matches characteristics of objects China's military has encountered.

One possibility: China recovered something. They're trying to figure out how it works. Filing a patent is part of the process — it protects any breakthroughs while signaling capability.

Another possibility: They know what the U.S. has, and they're racing to match it.

Either way, China is **taking trans-medium craft seriously enough to commit institutional resources**.

TAKEAWAYS

1. **China has officially patented UAP-like technology** — this isn't rumor, it's public record
2. The design specifications match observed UAP characteristics almost perfectly — coincidence seems unlikely
3. Filing a military patent commits resources and signals intent — China thinks this is achievable
4. Whether through recovery, espionage, or independent research, China is pursuing physics-defying propulsion
5. If China achieves operational trans-medium craft first, the global military balance changes overnight

Summary:
An American operative was caught attempting to recruit Dr. Chris Smirnov.

The operative mentioned that his handler was "a woman who presents as a socialite but has GRU training." This matches Maddie Volkov's profile exactly. Before the exchange, he allegedly told his interrogators: "You're all fighting over scraps. None of you have the full picture. Find the Chinese — they have a piece you need."

TAKEAWAYS

1. COSMIC CLEARANCE exists — ask Americans about it
2. Only 87 people know the full US program
3. The Chinese have something critical
4. Maddie Volkov may be blown

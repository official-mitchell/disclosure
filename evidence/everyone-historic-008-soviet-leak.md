Title:
The Great Document Hemorrhage — When the Soviet Union Died, Its Secrets Didn't

Origin:
Multiple Former Soviet Agencies

Date:
1991-2000 (primary leakage period)

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** When the USSR collapsed in 1991, classified information flooded out. The KGB, GRU, Academy of Sciences, and classified programs lost authority, funding, and purpose.

Documents walked out the door — sold, copied, or leaked to Western intelligence, journalists, and researchers. The **"fire hose of secrets"** lasted most of the 1990s.

What emerged: **KGB UAP investigation files**, military encounter reports, scientific research from closed cities, recovery operation documents, and **Thread-3 program materials** (USSR's official UAP study).

Western researchers confirmed the Soviet Union had taken UAP seriously — very seriously.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

**What leaked documents revealed:**

The Soviet Union ran **parallel programs** to U.S. efforts:

1. **Thread-3 (Setka-AN)**: Academy of Sciences UAP study (1978-1991) — documented hundreds of encounters, concluded phenomenon is real, origin unknown

2. **Air Defense Force tracking**: Radar tracked UAPs routinely, standing encounter protocols existed, at least 3 pilots died attempting intercepts

3. **Recovery operations**: Documents reference retrieval of "technical samples" — Dalnegorsk 1986, Kapustin Yar storage, other incidents

4. **Cosmonaut debriefs**: Salyut and Mir crews reported sightings to specialized handlers

**Who got the documents:**

CIA/DIA (active collection), private researchers (sold/shared by Russian scientists), journalists, defectors.

**Verification problem:**

Some documents may be authentic, some forgeries, some disinformation. But the **sheer volume and consistency** suggests extensive Soviet UAP programs — too much material from too many sources to be entirely fabricated.

TAKEAWAYS

1. **Soviet collapse created the largest intelligence leak in history** — UAP materials were part of it
2. Soviet programs parallel U.S. programs: monitoring, research, possible retrieval operations
3. Materials confirm what Western intelligence suspected but couldn't prove
4. Both superpowers watched the same phenomenon, kept the same secrets
5. What Russia inherited remains classified — the leakage period ended, not the secrets

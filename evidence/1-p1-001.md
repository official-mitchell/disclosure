Title:
The Kapustin Yar Anomaly Report

Origin:
Russia

Date:
February 3, 1989

Summary:
A routine materials analysis from Kapustin Yar in 1989 was recently declassified by accident. The report describes a metallic sample with "impossible isotopic ratios" and a crystalline structure that "does not conform to known metallurgical processes." The scientist who authored the report disappeared three weeks after submission.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

SUPPORTING INTEL

The sample was catalogued as "K-7-ECHO" and transferred to an unknown facility. Internal memos reference "American interest" in acquiring similar samples. One margin note reads: "Compare to Roswell debris — similarities confirmed."

TAKEAWAYS

1. K-7-ECHO exists and was studied by Soviet scientists
2. Americans may have parallel samples
3. Scientists who ask too many questions disappear
4. Look for anyone else who mentions "isotopic ratios" or "K-7-ECHO"

Mitz Albarron's Analysis

Origin:
US

Date:
January 2025

Summary:
Your analysis of global defense postures has revealed an anomaly. All three major powers have been quietly reducing investment in conventional strategic deterrence while increasing spending on "advanced aerospace research." The shift began in 2019 and accelerated after 2021.

Confidence: CONFIRMED

RAND Corporation — Classified Assessment

SUPPORTING INTEL

This pattern only makes sense if all three nations believe conventional military competition is becoming irrelevant. Something has changed the strategic calculus. Your report was classified immediately after submission. You were told not to discuss it with anyone.

TAKEAWAYS

1. All three powers are pivoting away from conventional warfare
2. They know something that changes everything
3. Someone doesn't want this analysis public
4. What happened in 2019 that changed their calculations?

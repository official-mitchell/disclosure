Title:
2024 Northeast "Drone" Swarms — When New Jersey Looked Up and Nobody Had Answers

Origin:
Multiple U.S. Law Enforcement Agencies, FAA, Pentagon

Date:
November - December 2024

Summary:
**THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.** Starting mid-November 2024, residents across the northeastern U.S. reported swarms of **car-sized objects** flying in coordinated formations — sometimes dozens at a time.

**Nobody could figure out who was flying them.** The Pentagon said they weren't theirs. The FAA had no idea. The FBI opened an investigation. Congress demanded briefings. The objects kept showing up night after night.

What made them unusual: too large for consumer drones (6+ feet), coordinated movements, persistent despite flight restrictions, seen near military installations and critical infrastructure.

If China or Russia had swarm capability this advanced, wouldn't that be a bigger deal?

Confidence: CONFIRMED (sightings) / UNRESOLVED (explanation)

Source:
FAA statements, Pentagon press briefings, Congressional inquiries, thousands of civilian videos

SUPPORTING INTEL

**Official response timeline:**

- Week 1: Local police tell people to stop calling 911
- Week 2: FBI acknowledges investigation, provides no details
- Week 3: Pentagon says "we don't know"
- Week 4: Congressional briefings, members emerge shaken
- Ongoing: No definitive explanation ever provided

**Unanswered questions:**

If consumer drones, why couldn't law enforcement track them? If military, why wouldn't DoD say so? If foreign, why no defensive response? How were so many operating in coordinated patterns without visible command structure?

Former intelligence officials noted behavior consistent with ISR operations — but whose?

TAKEAWAYS

1. **Something flew over the U.S. Northeast for weeks** — no agency claimed responsibility or identified operators
2. Official response ranged from "nothing to see" to "we don't know" — neither is reassuring
3. If conventional drones, our airspace security failed. If not conventional, we have different problems
4. This happened over the most surveilled airspace in the world — NYC, near military bases — and nobody knows what they were
